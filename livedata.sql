This trend has further intensified since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with states such as China having justified invasive and sophisticated forms of AI-powered surveillance for the sake of public health management. As Katherine Mason 1 has observed, China\'s epidemic management mechanism exhibits a \'permanent and intractable bifurcation of service and governance\' that not only leads to various ethical challenges but also closes the opportunities for the outside world to scrutinise the dire realities happening within the boundaries of the party-state.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hence, what we see is a state that comes with the intention of \'social governance\' but then transmutes itself into a surveillance state where the promises of governance are framed within coercive procedures of social control. The \'prevention and control\' (fangkong) doctrine that has been officially followed for handling previous public health crises in China since the SARS epidemic of 20032, remains instrumental for tackling the ongoing \'people&rsquo;s war&rsquo; against COVID-193. &nbsp; The &lsquo;prevention and control&rsquo; system thus in place is also increasingly being utilised for resolving political risks, tightening public security, and maintaining social stability4.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Amidst more informatised and intelligent forms of surveillance and control, especially when these technologies are widely exported, the geopolitical implications are worrisome. With these concerns, this issue brief attempts to study and analyse the consequences of China&rsquo;s &lsquo;intelligentised social governance&rsquo;. The brief is divided into two sections - the first section outlines the development of China&rsquo;s surveillance mechanisms over the years, and the second section identifies certain geopolitical implications of China&rsquo;s digital authoritarianism and surveillance practices.</p>\r\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">The Rise of the Surveillance State</h1>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While various social management and surveillance mechanisms have been carried out in China for many years, the term &lsquo;intelligentisation of social governance&rsquo; finds its genesis in the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan (AIDP). In July 2017, for building China&rsquo;s first-mover advantage in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the State Council announced the AIDP 5 . Alongside various targets, it envisaged the construction&nbsp; of a &lsquo;safe and convenient</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1 Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, Vintage, 1979</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">intelligent society&rsquo; and modernised &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; (shehui zhili) via the use of AI-enabled high-quality services in areas of governance such as administrative management, judicial management, urban management, and so on6. The document observes the need for an intelligent infrastructure powered by collaborative AI, big data and high-performance computing to significantly elevate capabilities to effectively &lsquo;construct governance&rsquo; for maintaining societal stability. Whilst party control over the public and public information for constructing governance has been practised for a long time throughout the communist party regime, particular leadership changes have effectuated certain distinct forms of surveillance and control in practice. Despite the promise of governance aimed at guidance rather than control by providing more responsibilities to the civil societies and market forces7, Hoffman and Mattis8 note that &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; that is being practised in the Xi Jinping era under the aegis of the State Security Committee has more centralising tendencies than the &lsquo;social management&rsquo; (shehui guanli) that was followed in the Hu Jintao era. The shift towards social governance to &lsquo;strengthen leadership by the Party committee&rsquo; and a &lsquo;leading role of the government9&rsquo; is significant to observe for the rise of the surveillance state, especially when it is increasingly equipping itself with high-tech tools to govern. Understanding the evolution of surveillance policy is essential to gauge the increasing presence of the Chinese surveillance state in people&rsquo;s socio-political lives today.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 1996, the State Council issued Order No. 95 for the &ldquo;Management of Computer Information Networks hooked up with International Networks&rdquo; that paved the initial path towards establishing the state&rsquo;s managerial power over its internet users through &ldquo;unified planning, unified standards, and separation of management at different levels&rdquo; 10. In 2000, after the Golden Shield Project (jindun gongcheng) was envisaged, China&rsquo;s internet, protected by the Great Firewall, was practically made into an intranet within its territory. The state tracked and censored controversial political opinions and online dissidents through this. It strengthened the state&rsquo;s internet censorship and allowed private players to provide data-driven solutions for the surveillance project.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thus, the Golden Shield Project was seen as a significant change from a generalised control of online content towards individualised user surveillance and automated information sharing11. It brought forth integrated information platforms (zonghe xinxi pingtai) and a four-tiered security network (gongan wang) that connected the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) with its local governance bureaus, thereby creating a unified command over police work12. It was only in 2013, after the establishment of the Cyberspace Administration Commission, the complete and centralised control of the state&rsquo;s internet entirely materialised. The Great Firewall now uses robust AI monitoring and filtering mechanisms to control social movements and people&rsquo;s mobilisation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another tool of the state&rsquo;s social management is the grassroots-level monitoring of the grid management system (wanggehua guanli) that became operational in some cities as early as 2004. Through a &lsquo;system of contracted responsibility&rsquo; (chengbao zeren zhi), cities were divided into basic &lsquo;management units of digital city&rsquo;, and information of residents and migrant workers was</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">collected for policing at the established grid levels13. With the goal of stability maintenance, the grid management system employs invasive approaches to gather citizen information. With more technologies assisting the data gathering and grid monitoring processes, the party-state has established encompassing top-down management of public security14. Besides grid management, to encourage innovation in the &lsquo;dynamic management of social conflicts&rsquo; and public opinion influence, the State Council issued guiding opinions on social management innovation&rsquo; in 2011. Through these opinions, the party fostered and invested in intermediary civil society organisations that promised to engage in the vision of stability maintenance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Intending to make China a &ldquo;strong internet power&rdquo;, the 12th Five Year Plan as well as the &ldquo;Internet Plus&rdquo; strategy of 2011, have led to increasing investments in the emerging fields of big data and Internet of Things (IoT). Consequently, such investments have enabled the state to create big data algorithms for the project of social surveillance, yet again. One such major development is the Social Credit System (shehui xinyong) which was first proposed in 201415. Based on big-data algorithms, this system evaluates a Chinese citizen\'s &ldquo;social trustworthiness&rdquo;. It is expected to cover all of the 1.4 billion Chinese citizens by 2022. The social credit system comes not only as a tool to evaluate the financial trustworthiness of the citizens but it also enables the technology- driven implementation of &ldquo;responsibility mechanisms&rdquo; and a simultaneous social control<sup>16</sup>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The involvement of private companies in the implementation of this project has further strengthened the technological infrastructures on which state surveillance is carried out 17 . Guidelines and warnings regarding the &ldquo;trustworthiness&rdquo; of citizens have been released since the rollout of the social credit system. Various documents and regulations released by the CPC (Communist Party of China)&rsquo;s Central Committee such as the &lsquo;Rongcheng Municipal Measures on Personal Credit Rewards and Punishments&rsquo;2, provincial regulations such as the &lsquo;Guangdong Provincial Social Credit Regulations&rsquo;3, and warning documents such as &lsquo;Warning and Punishment Mechanisms for Trust-Breakers&rsquo;, and more, imply the state&rsquo;s intentions of not only monitoring but also modifying the behavioural preferences and the conduct of its citizens. With AI-driven technologies and innovative prevention and control systems, the mechanisms of social governance are ubiquitously engrained into the daily lives of Chinese citizens. Hence, this is a notable shift from the yesteryears of &lsquo;management&rsquo; and maintenance of social stability.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Chinese tech-enabled surveillance reached its heights upon the implementation of the &lsquo;Sharp Eyes&rsquo; (xueliang) project in 2015. This project aimed at achieving complete coverage and &ldquo;full control&rdquo; of all of China&rsquo;s public areas by 202018. As a measure, the Ministry of Public Security called for a &ldquo;fully networked and fully controllable&rdquo; national video surveillance network. The ministry also instructed the nationwide &lsquo;Police Cloud&rsquo; project envisaging integrated gathering of</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2 For Translation, see - <a href=\"https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-punishment-measures/\">https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-</a> <a href=\"https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-punishment-measures/\">punishment-measures/</a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3 For Translation, see - <a href=\"https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/guandong-provincial-social-credit/\">https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/guandong-provincial-social-credit/</a></p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">four types of data: public security professional data, government department management data, public service agency business data, and Internet data 19.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The data thus gathered from citizens are as sensitively personal as their medical records, transaction histories with e-commerce companies, travel histories, etc.20. It is estimated that by the end of 2021, the total number of surveillance cameras will grow beyond 400 million &ndash; amounting to approximately one camera for every three citizens21. This shows that the extent of surveillance is on the rise in China. Furthermore, to enable joint work of such projects and to legitimise the proliferation of private technologies for the state&rsquo;s use, the National Intelligence Law of 2017 purported to &ldquo;unify and centralise&rdquo; intelligence systems 22 . Through this legislation, private companies are mandated for assisting and cooperating with the state&rsquo;s intelligence network. In 2018, The white paper on AI Security released by the Chinese Academy for Information Technology recommended public opinion monitoring and &lsquo;automating&rsquo; social governance, acknowledging the substantial role of private companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu in the implementation of the intelligentisation of social governance23.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Above all, some provinces\' surveillance intentions and procedures are more alarming than others, Xinjiang being the palpable reality. While predictive policing systems across the globe unduly harm ethnic minorities, and that racial bias is becoming disturbingly common, the practice of bio- metric surveillance in Xinjiang is a peculiar case. It comes with the blatantly pretentious promise of &ldquo;scientific decision-making&rdquo; towards public healthcare, poverty alleviation, and indeed, the maintenance of social stability. The &lsquo;Physicals for All&rsquo; programme that was launched in 2017 for the sake of &ldquo;national health examination work&rdquo; in Xinjiang24, forcibly collected blood samples and biometric details of the region&rsquo;s residents to create a DNA databank25. Being the first state to employ AI for racial profiling26, China&rsquo;s policies towards the Uyghur Muslims are undoubtedly driven by &lsquo;algorithms of repression&rsquo;. Mass surveillance in Xinjiang is conducted through the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP) that deploys &ldquo;wifi sniffers&rdquo;, machine sensors, and other sophisticated facial recognition technologies to monitor, store, and manage residents&rsquo; activities27. All the extracted data is localised within the domestic territory. For the Chinese state, the IJOP is a technological solution devised to &ldquo;inquire, investigate and thoroughly sort&rdquo; the ideological and familial issues of the population28. To target the Muslim minorities, mosques are labelled as &ldquo;high-risk&rdquo; areas and are monitored through real-time video. For striking hard against terrorism and Islamic extremism, the state utilises high-tech surveillance to vigil day-to-day activities, and profiles certain religious and cultural practices as &ldquo;pre-crimes&rdquo;. Ironically, at a time when such systems are systematically well-deployed and functioning, China has signed the United Nations&rsquo; pledge on banning AI for social scoring systems4.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">4 For further details, read UNESCO&rsquo;s draft text of the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Intelligence - https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379920.page=14</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">Concerns and Implications</h1>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite the sanguine possibilities portrayed by the party-state in the name of &lsquo;surveilling and serving&rsquo;, it is foreseeable that AI technologies will make authoritarianism more sustainable, at the least in the medium term29. Domestically, we see that public opinion is controlled and manipulated through automated internet censorship. Additionally, AI-powered technological ownership will enable Chairman Xi Jinping to assert more power and control over the party elites. In the international context, there are several consequences.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Firstly, the normalisation of mass surveillance systems and the state-enforced silences in the name of &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; are catastrophic to the imaginaries of individual civil liberties. The human rights issue is the primary problem, evidently seen in the covert and coercive monitoring mechanisms in the Xinjiang and Tibet Autonomous Regions. Severe incursions on reproductive rights of ethnic minorities (such as the campaigns against &lsquo;illegal births&rsquo;), their right to language and religion, and more importantly, their right to live together as a household are all devastatingly controlled by tech-intensive methods of digital enclosures. Given that China spends substantially more on internal security in its defence budget, further investments and deployment of intrusive technologies for effective surveillance and ethnic sorting are gravely concerning. Furthermore, the differences in how each state employs surveillance technologies and associated human rights issues will further widen the ideological gap between the western liberal international order and the nationalistic ambitions of the Chinese communist party.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Secondly, with the state embracing AI technologies with increasing speed and scale, the imminent indigenous innovation and technological self-sufficiency make the exercise of an aggressive foreign policy more expedient. In general, the ambitions of fragile and autocratic regimes to deploy mass surveillance are often hindered by the low level of domestic technological capabilities, thereby urging these regimes to get into international collaborations30. China&rsquo;s Belt Road Initiative (and a Digital Silk Road) becomes crucial here. With the entry of state-backed Chinese companies into the European and African markets, the export of security technologies is imminent31. As of 2018, thirty-six BRI countries have incorporated significant AI surveillance technologies for their domestic governance. In export technologies &ndash; mainly for smart city platforms, facial recognition systems, and smart policing - China is now the leading supplier of AI surveillance technology, according to the AI Global Surveillance Index32. The increasing export of these technologies can also lead to the adoption of CPC&rsquo;s practices for social and political control across states33. For instance, avowing effective public diplomacy, China trains Latin American and African journalists to utilise emerging technologies for their professions. These exports and training programmes influence include a vast number of actors that tend to form a &lsquo;security-industrial complex&rsquo; where private companies along with the MPS are progressively becoming responsible for the export of surveillance goods34.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In sum, we see that China&rsquo;s grand strategy of &lsquo;social stability and enduring peace&rsquo; is sought through an authoritarian flavour of digital entrenchment. China&rsquo;s informatisation and surveillance backbone is the big data-driven large-scale deployment of machine learning algorithms, AI, facial recognition technologies, and other sophisticated technologies backed by an intelligent infrastructure35. As discussed, AI technologies may appear to remedy regime&rsquo;s insecurity and as an efficient tool for social governance. This being said, nation-states should be cautious with their technological collaborations with China. The diffusion of AI-based surveillance power into society will not only distort democratic ideals but will also escalate geopolitical risks at an unprecedented and uncontrollable scale.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sruthi Kalyani is a research scholar at the Centre of East Asian Studies (Chinese Studies Division), School of International Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.

This list included more state-run media outlets which highlights further that the information that is circulated in the country will be monitored by the State. The reason given by the Chinese officials for this updated list was that media outlets were no longer meeting the requirements and have poor daily influence. But on the other side, this list has dropped a popular independent media outlet, Caixin, which is known for their investigative journalism, regular reporting on COVID-19, corruption climate crisis in China.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) manages control over its citizens via heavy media restrictions and censorship. Such restrictive media environments have birthed unique ventures coupled with nationalist \'netizens\' --also known as the <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2095458/rise-little-pink-chinas-young-angry-digital-warriors\">\'Little Pink\'</a> --that promote censorship to control information in the news, online, and on social media. China blocks many foreign websites, including Facebook, Instagram, and some Google services; still, the Chinese public has found ways to circumvent the so-called Great Firewall. The four major national networks, namely CSTNET, ChinaNet, CERNET and CHINAGBN, are the \"backbone\" of the mainland Chinese internet and ultimately seek to further the CCP\'s maintenance of the \'Great Firewall\'. They are state-funded, and therein owe allegiance to the Party.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Recently the Chinese government has also released its updated Market Access Negative List (MANL) which prohibited private investment in media outlets. As reported in ORCA\'s October 15, 2021 <a href=\"https://orcasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15.10.21-1.pdf\">CiCM newsletter</a>, pro-CCP netizens showed support for curb on private media companies via the Market Access Negative List. While the CCP maintains strict control over limiting any potential criticism of its practices, Weibo still emerges as a platform where citizens voice concerns over certain policies (in quickly censored posts). For instance, recent CiCM reports have covered instances of women voicing criticism of the <a href=\"https://orcasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/25.11.21-1.pdf\">one-child policy</a> and discussions over disco-</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">-<a href=\"https://orcasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23.11.21.pdf\">ntent </a>vis-a-vis the marriage leave system.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite such brief examples, such List(s) by the Chinese government raise serious threats to the quality of journalistic practices in the country and how that will shape up in the coming future. Via the MANL, Non-state funds are not allowed to engage in services including: news collection, editing and broadcasting businesses, investing in setting up and operating news organizations; operating pages, radio frequencies, channels, programs or social-media accounts of news organizations, live broadcast of events related to political views, public opinions or values, republishing news by foreign entities and forums or awards activities in the news media sector. This, coupled with the List of Internet Sources, only adds to the regulatory crackdown on a range of industries from Chinese authorities, especially the media sector.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 1, 'approved', 7, NULL, '2021-12-01 00:00:00', '2023-06-13 11:02:54');

This trend has further intensified since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with states such as China having justified invasive and sophisticated forms of AI-powered surveillance for the sake of public health management. As Katherine Mason 1 has observed, China\'s epidemic management mechanism exhibits a \'permanent and intractable bifurcation of service and governance\' that not only leads to various ethical challenges but also closes the opportunities for the outside world to scrutinise the dire realities happening within the boundaries of the party-state.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hence, what we see is a state that comes with the intention of \'social governance\' but then transmutes itself into a surveillance state where the promises of governance are framed within coercive procedures of social control. The \'prevention and control\' (fangkong) doctrine that has been officially followed for handling previous public health crises in China since the SARS epidemic of 20032, remains instrumental for tackling the ongoing \'people&rsquo;s war&rsquo; against COVID-193. &nbsp; The &lsquo;prevention and control&rsquo; system thus in place is also increasingly being utilised for resolving political risks, tightening public security, and maintaining social stability4.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Amidst more informatised and intelligent forms of surveillance and control, especially when these technologies are widely exported, the geopolitical implications are worrisome. With these concerns, this issue brief attempts to study and analyse the consequences of China&rsquo;s &lsquo;intelligentised social governance&rsquo;. The brief is divided into two sections - the first section outlines the development of China&rsquo;s surveillance mechanisms over the years, and the second section identifies certain geopolitical implications of China&rsquo;s digital authoritarianism and surveillance practices.</p>\r\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">The Rise of the Surveillance State</h1>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While various social management and surveillance mechanisms have been carried out in China for many years, the term &lsquo;intelligentisation of social governance&rsquo; finds its genesis in the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan (AIDP). In July 2017, for building China&rsquo;s first-mover advantage in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the State Council announced the AIDP 5 . Alongside various targets, it envisaged the construction&nbsp; of a &lsquo;safe and convenient</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1 Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, Vintage, 1979</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">intelligent society&rsquo; and modernised &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; (shehui zhili) via the use of AI-enabled high-quality services in areas of governance such as administrative management, judicial management, urban management, and so on6. The document observes the need for an intelligent infrastructure powered by collaborative AI, big data and high-performance computing to significantly elevate capabilities to effectively &lsquo;construct governance&rsquo; for maintaining societal stability. Whilst party control over the public and public information for constructing governance has been practised for a long time throughout the communist party regime, particular leadership changes have effectuated certain distinct forms of surveillance and control in practice. Despite the promise of governance aimed at guidance rather than control by providing more responsibilities to the civil societies and market forces7, Hoffman and Mattis8 note that &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; that is being practised in the Xi Jinping era under the aegis of the State Security Committee has more centralising tendencies than the &lsquo;social management&rsquo; (shehui guanli) that was followed in the Hu Jintao era. The shift towards social governance to &lsquo;strengthen leadership by the Party committee&rsquo; and a &lsquo;leading role of the government9&rsquo; is significant to observe for the rise of the surveillance state, especially when it is increasingly equipping itself with high-tech tools to govern. Understanding the evolution of surveillance policy is essential to gauge the increasing presence of the Chinese surveillance state in people&rsquo;s socio-political lives today.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 1996, the State Council issued Order No. 95 for the &ldquo;Management of Computer Information Networks hooked up with International Networks&rdquo; that paved the initial path towards establishing the state&rsquo;s managerial power over its internet users through &ldquo;unified planning, unified standards, and separation of management at different levels&rdquo; 10. In 2000, after the Golden Shield Project (jindun gongcheng) was envisaged, China&rsquo;s internet, protected by the Great Firewall, was practically made into an intranet within its territory. The state tracked and censored controversial political opinions and online dissidents through this. It strengthened the state&rsquo;s internet censorship and allowed private players to provide data-driven solutions for the surveillance project.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thus, the Golden Shield Project was seen as a significant change from a generalised control of online content towards individualised user surveillance and automated information sharing11. It brought forth integrated information platforms (zonghe xinxi pingtai) and a four-tiered security network (gongan wang) that connected the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) with its local governance bureaus, thereby creating a unified command over police work12. It was only in 2013, after the establishment of the Cyberspace Administration Commission, the complete and centralised control of the state&rsquo;s internet entirely materialised. The Great Firewall now uses robust AI monitoring and filtering mechanisms to control social movements and people&rsquo;s mobilisation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another tool of the state&rsquo;s social management is the grassroots-level monitoring of the grid management system (wanggehua guanli) that became operational in some cities as early as 2004. Through a &lsquo;system of contracted responsibility&rsquo; (chengbao zeren zhi), cities were divided into basic &lsquo;management units of digital city&rsquo;, and information of residents and migrant workers was</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">collected for policing at the established grid levels13. With the goal of stability maintenance, the grid management system employs invasive approaches to gather citizen information. With more technologies assisting the data gathering and grid monitoring processes, the party-state has established encompassing top-down management of public security14. Besides grid management, to encourage innovation in the &lsquo;dynamic management of social conflicts&rsquo; and public opinion influence, the State Council issued guiding opinions on social management innovation&rsquo; in 2011. Through these opinions, the party fostered and invested in intermediary civil society organisations that promised to engage in the vision of stability maintenance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Intending to make China a &ldquo;strong internet power&rdquo;, the 12th Five Year Plan as well as the &ldquo;Internet Plus&rdquo; strategy of 2011, have led to increasing investments in the emerging fields of big data and Internet of Things (IoT). Consequently, such investments have enabled the state to create big data algorithms for the project of social surveillance, yet again. One such major development is the Social Credit System (shehui xinyong) which was first proposed in 201415. Based on big-data algorithms, this system evaluates a Chinese citizen\'s &ldquo;social trustworthiness&rdquo;. It is expected to cover all of the 1.4 billion Chinese citizens by 2022. The social credit system comes not only as a tool to evaluate the financial trustworthiness of the citizens but it also enables the technology- driven implementation of &ldquo;responsibility mechanisms&rdquo; and a simultaneous social control<sup>16</sup>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The involvement of private companies in the implementation of this project has further strengthened the technological infrastructures on which state surveillance is carried out 17 . Guidelines and warnings regarding the &ldquo;trustworthiness&rdquo; of citizens have been released since the rollout of the social credit system. Various documents and regulations released by the CPC (Communist Party of China)&rsquo;s Central Committee such as the &lsquo;Rongcheng Municipal Measures on Personal Credit Rewards and Punishments&rsquo;2, provincial regulations such as the &lsquo;Guangdong Provincial Social Credit Regulations&rsquo;3, and warning documents such as &lsquo;Warning and Punishment Mechanisms for Trust-Breakers&rsquo;, and more, imply the state&rsquo;s intentions of not only monitoring but also modifying the behavioural preferences and the conduct of its citizens. With AI-driven technologies and innovative prevention and control systems, the mechanisms of social governance are ubiquitously engrained into the daily lives of Chinese citizens. Hence, this is a notable shift from the yesteryears of &lsquo;management&rsquo; and maintenance of social stability.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Chinese tech-enabled surveillance reached its heights upon the implementation of the &lsquo;Sharp Eyes&rsquo; (xueliang) project in 2015. This project aimed at achieving complete coverage and &ldquo;full control&rdquo; of all of China&rsquo;s public areas by 202018. As a measure, the Ministry of Public Security called for a &ldquo;fully networked and fully controllable&rdquo; national video surveillance network. The ministry also instructed the nationwide &lsquo;Police Cloud&rsquo; project envisaging integrated gathering of</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2 For Translation, see - <a href=\"https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-punishment-measures/\">https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-</a> <a href=\"https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-punishment-measures/\">punishment-measures/</a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3 For Translation, see - <a href=\"https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/guandong-provincial-social-credit/\">https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/guandong-provincial-social-credit/</a></p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">four types of data: public security professional data, government department management data, public service agency business data, and Internet data 19.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The data thus gathered from citizens are as sensitively personal as their medical records, transaction histories with e-commerce companies, travel histories, etc.20. It is estimated that by the end of 2021, the total number of surveillance cameras will grow beyond 400 million &ndash; amounting to approximately one camera for every three citizens21. This shows that the extent of surveillance is on the rise in China. Furthermore, to enable joint work of such projects and to legitimise the proliferation of private technologies for the state&rsquo;s use, the National Intelligence Law of 2017 purported to &ldquo;unify and centralise&rdquo; intelligence systems 22 . Through this legislation, private companies are mandated for assisting and cooperating with the state&rsquo;s intelligence network. In 2018, The white paper on AI Security released by the Chinese Academy for Information Technology recommended public opinion monitoring and &lsquo;automating&rsquo; social governance, acknowledging the substantial role of private companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu in the implementation of the intelligentisation of social governance23.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Above all, some provinces\' surveillance intentions and procedures are more alarming than others, Xinjiang being the palpable reality. While predictive policing systems across the globe unduly harm ethnic minorities, and that racial bias is becoming disturbingly common, the practice of bio- metric surveillance in Xinjiang is a peculiar case. It comes with the blatantly pretentious promise of &ldquo;scientific decision-making&rdquo; towards public healthcare, poverty alleviation, and indeed, the maintenance of social stability. The &lsquo;Physicals for All&rsquo; programme that was launched in 2017 for the sake of &ldquo;national health examination work&rdquo; in Xinjiang24, forcibly collected blood samples and biometric details of the region&rsquo;s residents to create a DNA databank25. Being the first state to employ AI for racial profiling26, China&rsquo;s policies towards the Uyghur Muslims are undoubtedly driven by &lsquo;algorithms of repression&rsquo;. Mass surveillance in Xinjiang is conducted through the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP) that deploys &ldquo;wifi sniffers&rdquo;, machine sensors, and other sophisticated facial recognition technologies to monitor, store, and manage residents&rsquo; activities27. All the extracted data is localised within the domestic territory. For the Chinese state, the IJOP is a technological solution devised to &ldquo;inquire, investigate and thoroughly sort&rdquo; the ideological and familial issues of the population28. To target the Muslim minorities, mosques are labelled as &ldquo;high-risk&rdquo; areas and are monitored through real-time video. For striking hard against terrorism and Islamic extremism, the state utilises high-tech surveillance to vigil day-to-day activities, and profiles certain religious and cultural practices as &ldquo;pre-crimes&rdquo;. Ironically, at a time when such systems are systematically well-deployed and functioning, China has signed the United Nations&rsquo; pledge on banning AI for social scoring systems4.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">4 For further details, read UNESCO&rsquo;s draft text of the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Intelligence - https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379920.page=14</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">Concerns and Implications</h1>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite the sanguine possibilities portrayed by the party-state in the name of &lsquo;surveilling and serving&rsquo;, it is foreseeable that AI technologies will make authoritarianism more sustainable, at the least in the medium term29. Domestically, we see that public opinion is controlled and manipulated through automated internet censorship. Additionally, AI-powered technological ownership will enable Chairman Xi Jinping to assert more power and control over the party elites. In the international context, there are several consequences.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Firstly, the normalisation of mass surveillance systems and the state-enforced silences in the name of &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; are catastrophic to the imaginaries of individual civil liberties. The human rights issue is the primary problem, evidently seen in the covert and coercive monitoring mechanisms in the Xinjiang and Tibet Autonomous Regions. Severe incursions on reproductive rights of ethnic minorities (such as the campaigns against &lsquo;illegal births&rsquo;), their right to language and religion, and more importantly, their right to live together as a household are all devastatingly controlled by tech-intensive methods of digital enclosures. Given that China spends substantially more on internal security in its defence budget, further investments and deployment of intrusive technologies for effective surveillance and ethnic sorting are gravely concerning. Furthermore, the differences in how each state employs surveillance technologies and associated human rights issues will further widen the ideological gap between the western liberal international order and the nationalistic ambitions of the Chinese communist party.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Secondly, with the state embracing AI technologies with increasing speed and scale, the imminent indigenous innovation and technological self-sufficiency make the exercise of an aggressive foreign policy more expedient. In general, the ambitions of fragile and autocratic regimes to deploy mass surveillance are often hindered by the low level of domestic technological capabilities, thereby urging these regimes to get into international collaborations30. China&rsquo;s Belt Road Initiative (and a Digital Silk Road) becomes crucial here. With the entry of state-backed Chinese companies into the European and African markets, the export of security technologies is imminent31. As of 2018, thirty-six BRI countries have incorporated significant AI surveillance technologies for their domestic governance. In export technologies &ndash; mainly for smart city platforms, facial recognition systems, and smart policing - China is now the leading supplier of AI surveillance technology, according to the AI Global Surveillance Index32. The increasing export of these technologies can also lead to the adoption of CPC&rsquo;s practices for social and political control across states33. For instance, avowing effective public diplomacy, China trains Latin American and African journalists to utilise emerging technologies for their professions. These exports and training programmes influence include a vast number of actors that tend to form a &lsquo;security-industrial complex&rsquo; where private companies along with the MPS are progressively becoming responsible for the export of surveillance goods34.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In sum, we see that China&rsquo;s grand strategy of &lsquo;social stability and enduring peace&rsquo; is sought through an authoritarian flavour of digital entrenchment. China&rsquo;s informatisation and surveillance backbone is the big data-driven large-scale deployment of machine learning algorithms, AI, facial recognition technologies, and other sophisticated technologies backed by an intelligent infrastructure35. As discussed, AI technologies may appear to remedy regime&rsquo;s insecurity and as an efficient tool for social governance. This being said, nation-states should be cautious with their technological collaborations with China. The diffusion of AI-based surveillance power into society will not only distort democratic ideals but will also escalate geopolitical risks at an unprecedented and uncontrollable scale.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sruthi Kalyani is a research scholar at the Centre of East Asian Studies (Chinese Studies Division), School of International Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.

In July 2017, for building China&rsquo;s first-mover advantage in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the State Council announced the AIDP 5 . Alongside various targets, it envisaged the construction&nbsp; of a &lsquo;safe and convenient</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1 Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, Vintage, 1979</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">intelligent society&rsquo; and modernised &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; (shehui zhili) via the use of AI-enabled high-quality services in areas of governance such as administrative management, judicial management, urban management, and so on6. The document observes the need for an intelligent infrastructure powered by collaborative AI, big data and high-performance computing to significantly elevate capabilities to effectively &lsquo;construct governance&rsquo; for maintaining societal stability. Whilst party control over the public and public information for constructing governance has been practised for a long time throughout the communist party regime, particular leadership changes have effectuated certain distinct forms of surveillance and control in practice. Despite the promise of governance aimed at guidance rather than control by providing more responsibilities to the civil societies and market forces7, Hoffman and Mattis8 note that &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; that is being practised in the Xi Jinping era under the aegis of the State Security Committee has more centralising tendencies than the &lsquo;social management&rsquo; (shehui guanli) that was followed in the Hu Jintao era. The shift towards social governance to &lsquo;strengthen leadership by the Party committee&rsquo; and a &lsquo;leading role of the government9&rsquo; is significant to observe for the rise of the surveillance state, especially when it is increasingly equipping itself with high-tech tools to govern. Understanding the evolution of surveillance policy is essential to gauge the increasing presence of the Chinese surveillance state in people&rsquo;s socio-political lives today.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 1996, the State Council issued Order No. 95 for the &ldquo;Management of Computer Information Networks hooked up with International Networks&rdquo; that paved the initial path towards establishing the state&rsquo;s managerial power over its internet users through &ldquo;unified planning, unified standards, and separation of management at different levels&rdquo; 10. In 2000, after the Golden Shield Project (jindun gongcheng) was envisaged, China&rsquo;s internet, protected by the Great Firewall, was practically made into an intranet within its territory. The state tracked and censored controversial political opinions and online dissidents through this. It strengthened the state&rsquo;s internet censorship and allowed private players to provide data-driven solutions for the surveillance project.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thus, the Golden Shield Project was seen as a significant change from a generalised control of online content towards individualised user surveillance and automated information sharing11. It brought forth integrated information platforms (zonghe xinxi pingtai) and a four-tiered security network (gongan wang) that connected the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) with its local governance bureaus, thereby creating a unified command over police work12. It was only in 2013, after the establishment of the Cyberspace Administration Commission, the complete and centralised control of the state&rsquo;s internet entirely materialised. The Great Firewall now uses robust AI monitoring and filtering mechanisms to control social movements and people&rsquo;s mobilisation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another tool of the state&rsquo;s social management is the grassroots-level monitoring of the grid management system (wanggehua guanli) that became operational in some cities as early as 2004. Through a &lsquo;system of contracted responsibility&rsquo; (chengbao zeren zhi), cities were divided into basic &lsquo;management units of digital city&rsquo;, and information of residents and migrant workers was</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">collected for policing at the established grid levels13. With the goal of stability maintenance, the grid management system employs invasive approaches to gather citizen information. With more technologies assisting the data gathering and grid monitoring processes, the party-state has established encompassing top-down management of public security14. Besides grid management, to encourage innovation in the &lsquo;dynamic management of social conflicts&rsquo; and public opinion influence, the State Council issued guiding opinions on social management innovation&rsquo; in 2011. Through these opinions, the party fostered and invested in intermediary civil society organisations that promised to engage in the vision of stability maintenance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Intending to make China a &ldquo;strong internet power&rdquo;, the 12th Five Year Plan as well as the &ldquo;Internet Plus&rdquo; strategy of 2011, have led to increasing investments in the emerging fields of big data and Internet of Things (IoT). Consequently, such investments have enabled the state to create big data algorithms for the project of social surveillance, yet again. One such major development is the Social Credit System (shehui xinyong) which was first proposed in 201415. Based on big-data algorithms, this system evaluates a Chinese citizen\'s &ldquo;social trustworthiness&rdquo;. It is expected to cover all of the 1.4 billion Chinese citizens by 2022. The social credit system comes not only as a tool to evaluate the financial trustworthiness of the citizens but it also enables the technology- driven implementation of &ldquo;responsibility mechanisms&rdquo; and a simultaneous social control<sup>16</sup>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The involvement of private companies in the implementation of this project has further strengthened the technological infrastructures on which state surveillance is carried out 17 . Guidelines and warnings regarding the &ldquo;trustworthiness&rdquo; of citizens have been released since the rollout of the social credit system. Various documents and regulations released by the CPC (Communist Party of China)&rsquo;s Central Committee such as the &lsquo;Rongcheng Municipal Measures on Personal Credit Rewards and Punishments&rsquo;2, provincial regulations such as the &lsquo;Guangdong Provincial Social Credit Regulations&rsquo;3, and warning documents such as &lsquo;Warning and Punishment Mechanisms for Trust-Breakers&rsquo;, and more, imply the state&rsquo;s intentions of not only monitoring but also modifying the behavioural preferences and the conduct of its citizens. With AI-driven technologies and innovative prevention and control systems, the mechanisms of social governance are ubiquitously engrained into the daily lives of Chinese citizens. Hence, this is a notable shift from the yesteryears of &lsquo;management&rsquo; and maintenance of social stability.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Chinese tech-enabled surveillance reached its heights upon the implementation of the &lsquo;Sharp Eyes&rsquo; (xueliang) project in 2015. This project aimed at achieving complete coverage and &ldquo;full control&rdquo; of all of China&rsquo;s public areas by 202018. As a measure, the Ministry of Public Security called for a &ldquo;fully networked and fully controllable&rdquo; national video surveillance network. The ministry also instructed the nationwide &lsquo;Police Cloud&rsquo; project envisaging integrated gathering of</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2 For Translation, see - <a href=\"https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-punishment-measures/\">https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-</a> <a href=\"https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-punishment-measures/\">punishment-measures/</a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3 For Translation, see - <a href=\"https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/guandong-provincial-social-credit/\">https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/guandong-provincial-social-credit/</a></p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">four types of data: public security professional data, government department management data, public service agency business data, and Internet data 19.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The data thus gathered from citizens are as sensitively personal as their medical records, transaction histories with e-commerce companies, travel histories, etc.20. It is estimated that by the end of 2021, the total number of surveillance cameras will grow beyond 400 million &ndash; amounting to approximately one camera for every three citizens21. This shows that the extent of surveillance is on the rise in China. Furthermore, to enable joint work of such projects and to legitimise the proliferation of private technologies for the state&rsquo;s use, the National Intelligence Law of 2017 purported to &ldquo;unify and centralise&rdquo; intelligence systems 22 . Through this legislation, private companies are mandated for assisting and cooperating with the state&rsquo;s intelligence network. In 2018, The white paper on AI Security released by the Chinese Academy for Information Technology recommended public opinion monitoring and &lsquo;automating&rsquo; social governance, acknowledging the substantial role of private companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu in the implementation of the intelligentisation of social governance23.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Above all, some provinces\' surveillance intentions and procedures are more alarming than others, Xinjiang being the palpable reality. While predictive policing systems across the globe unduly harm ethnic minorities, and that racial bias is becoming disturbingly common, the practice of bio- metric surveillance in Xinjiang is a peculiar case. It comes with the blatantly pretentious promise of &ldquo;scientific decision-making&rdquo; towards public healthcare, poverty alleviation, and indeed, the maintenance of social stability. The &lsquo;Physicals for All&rsquo; programme that was launched in 2017 for the sake of &ldquo;national health examination work&rdquo; in Xinjiang24, forcibly collected blood samples and biometric details of the region&rsquo;s residents to create a DNA databank25. Being the first state to employ AI for racial profiling26, China&rsquo;s policies towards the Uyghur Muslims are undoubtedly driven by &lsquo;algorithms of repression&rsquo;. Mass surveillance in Xinjiang is conducted through the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP) that deploys &ldquo;wifi sniffers&rdquo;, machine sensors, and other sophisticated facial recognition technologies to monitor, store, and manage residents&rsquo; activities27. All the extracted data is localised within the domestic territory. For the Chinese state, the IJOP is a technological solution devised to &ldquo;inquire, investigate and thoroughly sort&rdquo; the ideological and familial issues of the population28. To target the Muslim minorities, mosques are labelled as &ldquo;high-risk&rdquo; areas and are monitored through real-time video. For striking hard against terrorism and Islamic extremism, the state utilises high-tech surveillance to vigil day-to-day activities, and profiles certain religious and cultural practices as &ldquo;pre-crimes&rdquo;. Ironically, at a time when such systems are systematically well-deployed and functioning, China has signed the United Nations&rsquo; pledge on banning AI for social scoring systems4.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">4 For further details, read UNESCO&rsquo;s draft text of the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Intelligence - https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379920.page=14</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">Concerns and Implications</h1>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite the sanguine possibilities portrayed by the party-state in the name of &lsquo;surveilling and serving&rsquo;, it is foreseeable that AI technologies will make authoritarianism more sustainable, at the least in the medium term29. Domestically, we see that public opinion is controlled and manipulated through automated internet censorship. Additionally, AI-powered technological ownership will enable Chairman Xi Jinping to assert more power and control over the party elites. In the international context, there are several consequences.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Firstly, the normalisation of mass surveillance systems and the state-enforced silences in the name of &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; are catastrophic to the imaginaries of individual civil liberties. The human rights issue is the primary problem, evidently seen in the covert and coercive monitoring mechanisms in the Xinjiang and Tibet Autonomous Regions. Severe incursions on reproductive rights of ethnic minorities (such as the campaigns against &lsquo;illegal births&rsquo;), their right to language and religion, and more importantly, their right to live together as a household are all devastatingly controlled by tech-intensive methods of digital enclosures. Given that China spends substantially more on internal security in its defence budget, further investments and deployment of intrusive technologies for effective surveillance and ethnic sorting are gravely concerning. Furthermore, the differences in how each state employs surveillance technologies and associated human rights issues will further widen the ideological gap between the western liberal international order and the nationalistic ambitions of the Chinese communist party.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Secondly, with the state embracing AI technologies with increasing speed and scale, the imminent indigenous innovation and technological self-sufficiency make the exercise of an aggressive foreign policy more expedient. In general, the ambitions of fragile and autocratic regimes to deploy mass surveillance are often hindered by the low level of domestic technological capabilities, thereby urging these regimes to get into international collaborations30. China&rsquo;s Belt Road Initiative (and a Digital Silk Road) becomes crucial here. With the entry of state-backed Chinese companies into the European and African markets, the export of security technologies is imminent31. As of 2018, thirty-six BRI countries have incorporated significant AI surveillance technologies for their domestic governance. In export technologies &ndash; mainly for smart city platforms, facial recognition systems, and smart policing - China is now the leading supplier of AI surveillance technology, according to the AI Global Surveillance Index32. The increasing export of these technologies can also lead to the adoption of CPC&rsquo;s practices for social and political control across states33. For instance, avowing effective public diplomacy, China trains Latin American and African journalists to utilise emerging technologies for their professions. These exports and training programmes influence include a vast number of actors that tend to form a &lsquo;security-industrial complex&rsquo; where private companies along with the MPS are progressively becoming responsible for the export of surveillance goods34.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In sum, we see that China&rsquo;s grand strategy of &lsquo;social stability and enduring peace&rsquo; is sought through an authoritarian flavour of digital entrenchment. China&rsquo;s informatisation and surveillance backbone is the big data-driven large-scale deployment of machine learning algorithms, AI, facial recognition technologies, and other sophisticated technologies backed by an intelligent infrastructure35. As discussed, AI technologies may appear to remedy regime&rsquo;s insecurity and as an efficient tool for social governance. This being said, nation-states should be cautious with their technological collaborations with China. The diffusion of AI-based surveillance power into society will not only distort democratic ideals but will also escalate geopolitical risks at an unprecedented and uncontrollable scale.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sruthi Kalyani is a research scholar at the Centre of East Asian Studies (Chinese Studies Division), School of International Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.

In July 2017, for building China&rsquo;s first-mover advantage in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the State Council announced the AIDP 5 . Alongside various targets, it envisaged the construction&nbsp; of a &lsquo;safe and convenient</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1 Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, Vintage, 1979</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">intelligent society&rsquo; and modernised &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; (shehui zhili) via the use of AI-enabled high-quality services in areas of governance such as administrative management, judicial management, urban management, and so on6. The document observes the need for an intelligent infrastructure powered by collaborative AI, big data and high-performance computing to significantly elevate capabilities to effectively &lsquo;construct governance&rsquo; for maintaining societal stability. Whilst party control over the public and public information for constructing governance has been practised for a long time throughout the communist party regime, particular leadership changes have effectuated certain distinct forms of surveillance and control in practice. Despite the promise of governance aimed at guidance rather than control by providing more responsibilities to the civil societies and market forces7, Hoffman and Mattis8 note that &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; that is being practised in the Xi Jinping era under the aegis of the State Security Committee has more centralising tendencies than the &lsquo;social management&rsquo; (shehui guanli) that was followed in the Hu Jintao era. The shift towards social governance to &lsquo;strengthen leadership by the Party committee&rsquo; and a &lsquo;leading role of the government9&rsquo; is significant to observe for the rise of the surveillance state, especially when it is increasingly equipping itself with high-tech tools to govern. Understanding the evolution of surveillance policy is essential to gauge the increasing presence of the Chinese surveillance state in people&rsquo;s socio-political lives today.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 1996, the State Council issued Order No. 95 for the &ldquo;Management of Computer Information Networks hooked up with International Networks&rdquo; that paved the initial path towards establishing the state&rsquo;s managerial power over its internet users through &ldquo;unified planning, unified standards, and separation of management at different levels&rdquo; 10. In 2000, after the Golden Shield Project (jindun gongcheng) was envisaged, China&rsquo;s internet, protected by the Great Firewall, was practically made into an intranet within its territory. The state tracked and censored controversial political opinions and online dissidents through this. It strengthened the state&rsquo;s internet censorship and allowed private players to provide data-driven solutions for the surveillance project.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thus, the Golden Shield Project was seen as a significant change from a generalised control of online content towards individualised user surveillance and automated information sharing11. It brought forth integrated information platforms (zonghe xinxi pingtai) and a four-tiered security network (gongan wang) that connected the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) with its local governance bureaus, thereby creating a unified command over police work12. It was only in 2013, after the establishment of the Cyberspace Administration Commission, the complete and centralised control of the state&rsquo;s internet entirely materialised. The Great Firewall now uses robust AI monitoring and filtering mechanisms to control social movements and people&rsquo;s mobilisation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another tool of the state&rsquo;s social management is the grassroots-level monitoring of the grid management system (wanggehua guanli) that became operational in some cities as early as 2004. Through a &lsquo;system of contracted responsibility&rsquo; (chengbao zeren zhi), cities were divided into basic &lsquo;management units of digital city&rsquo;, and information of residents and migrant workers was</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">collected for policing at the established grid levels13. With the goal of stability maintenance, the grid management system employs invasive approaches to gather citizen information. With more technologies assisting the data gathering and grid monitoring processes, the party-state has established encompassing top-down management of public security14. Besides grid management, to encourage innovation in the &lsquo;dynamic management of social conflicts&rsquo; and public opinion influence, the State Council issued guiding opinions on social management innovation&rsquo; in 2011. Through these opinions, the party fostered and invested in intermediary civil society organisations that promised to engage in the vision of stability maintenance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Intending to make China a &ldquo;strong internet power&rdquo;, the 12th Five Year Plan as well as the &ldquo;Internet Plus&rdquo; strategy of 2011, have led to increasing investments in the emerging fields of big data and Internet of Things (IoT). Consequently, such investments have enabled the state to create big data algorithms for the project of social surveillance, yet again. One such major development is the Social Credit System (shehui xinyong) which was first proposed in 201415. Based on big-data algorithms, this system evaluates a Chinese citizen\'s &ldquo;social trustworthiness&rdquo;. It is expected to cover all of the 1.4 billion Chinese citizens by 2022. The social credit system comes not only as a tool to evaluate the financial trustworthiness of the citizens but it also enables the technology- driven implementation of &ldquo;responsibility mechanisms&rdquo; and a simultaneous social control<sup>16</sup>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The involvement of private companies in the implementation of this project has further strengthened the technological infrastructures on which state surveillance is carried out 17 . Guidelines and warnings regarding the &ldquo;trustworthiness&rdquo; of citizens have been released since the rollout of the social credit system. Various documents and regulations released by the CPC (Communist Party of China)&rsquo;s Central Committee such as the &lsquo;Rongcheng Municipal Measures on Personal Credit Rewards and Punishments&rsquo;2, provincial regulations such as the &lsquo;Guangdong Provincial Social Credit Regulations&rsquo;3, and warning documents such as &lsquo;Warning and Punishment Mechanisms for Trust-Breakers&rsquo;, and more, imply the state&rsquo;s intentions of not only monitoring but also modifying the behavioural preferences and the conduct of its citizens. With AI-driven technologies and innovative prevention and control systems, the mechanisms of social governance are ubiquitously engrained into the daily lives of Chinese citizens. Hence, this is a notable shift from the yesteryears of &lsquo;management&rsquo; and maintenance of social stability.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Chinese tech-enabled surveillance reached its heights upon the implementation of the &lsquo;Sharp Eyes&rsquo; (xueliang) project in 2015. This project aimed at achieving complete coverage and &ldquo;full control&rdquo; of all of China&rsquo;s public areas by 202018. As a measure, the Ministry of Public Security called for a &ldquo;fully networked and fully controllable&rdquo; national video surveillance network. The ministry also instructed the nationwide &lsquo;Police Cloud&rsquo; project envisaging integrated gathering of</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2 For Translation, see - <a href=\"https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-punishment-measures/\">https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-</a> <a href=\"https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-punishment-measures/\">punishment-measures/</a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3 For Translation, see - <a href=\"https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/guandong-provincial-social-credit/\">https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/guandong-provincial-social-credit/</a></p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">four types of data: public security professional data, government department management data, public service agency business data, and Internet data 19.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The data thus gathered from citizens are as sensitively personal as their medical records, transaction histories with e-commerce companies, travel histories, etc.20. It is estimated that by the end of 2021, the total number of surveillance cameras will grow beyond 400 million &ndash; amounting to approximately one camera for every three citizens21. This shows that the extent of surveillance is on the rise in China. Furthermore, to enable joint work of such projects and to legitimise the proliferation of private technologies for the state&rsquo;s use, the National Intelligence Law of 2017 purported to &ldquo;unify and centralise&rdquo; intelligence systems 22 . Through this legislation, private companies are mandated for assisting and cooperating with the state&rsquo;s intelligence network. In 2018, The white paper on AI Security released by the Chinese Academy for Information Technology recommended public opinion monitoring and &lsquo;automating&rsquo; social governance, acknowledging the substantial role of private companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu in the implementation of the intelligentisation of social governance23.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Above all, some provinces\' surveillance intentions and procedures are more alarming than others, Xinjiang being the palpable reality. While predictive policing systems across the globe unduly harm ethnic minorities, and that racial bias is becoming disturbingly common, the practice of bio- metric surveillance in Xinjiang is a peculiar case. It comes with the blatantly pretentious promise of &ldquo;scientific decision-making&rdquo; towards public healthcare, poverty alleviation, and indeed, the maintenance of social stability. The &lsquo;Physicals for All&rsquo; programme that was launched in 2017 for the sake of &ldquo;national health examination work&rdquo; in Xinjiang24, forcibly collected blood samples and biometric details of the region&rsquo;s residents to create a DNA databank25. Being the first state to employ AI for racial profiling26, China&rsquo;s policies towards the Uyghur Muslims are undoubtedly driven by &lsquo;algorithms of repression&rsquo;. Mass surveillance in Xinjiang is conducted through the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP) that deploys &ldquo;wifi sniffers&rdquo;, machine sensors, and other sophisticated facial recognition technologies to monitor, store, and manage residents&rsquo; activities27. All the extracted data is localised within the domestic territory. For the Chinese state, the IJOP is a technological solution devised to &ldquo;inquire, investigate and thoroughly sort&rdquo; the ideological and familial issues of the population28. To target the Muslim minorities, mosques are labelled as &ldquo;high-risk&rdquo; areas and are monitored through real-time video. For striking hard against terrorism and Islamic extremism, the state utilises high-tech surveillance to vigil day-to-day activities, and profiles certain religious and cultural practices as &ldquo;pre-crimes&rdquo;. Ironically, at a time when such systems are systematically well-deployed and functioning, China has signed the United Nations&rsquo; pledge on banning AI for social scoring systems4.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">4 For further details, read UNESCO&rsquo;s draft text of the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Intelligence - https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379920.page=14</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">Concerns and Implications</h1>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite the sanguine possibilities portrayed by the party-state in the name of &lsquo;surveilling and serving&rsquo;, it is foreseeable that AI technologies will make authoritarianism more sustainable, at the least in the medium term29. Domestically, we see that public opinion is controlled and manipulated through automated internet censorship. Additionally, AI-powered technological ownership will enable Chairman Xi Jinping to assert more power and control over the party elites. In the international context, there are several consequences.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Firstly, the normalisation of mass surveillance systems and the state-enforced silences in the name of &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; are catastrophic to the imaginaries of individual civil liberties. The human rights issue is the primary problem, evidently seen in the covert and coercive monitoring mechanisms in the Xinjiang and Tibet Autonomous Regions. Severe incursions on reproductive rights of ethnic minorities (such as the campaigns against &lsquo;illegal births&rsquo;), their right to language and religion, and more importantly, their right to live together as a household are all devastatingly controlled by tech-intensive methods of digital enclosures. Given that China spends substantially more on internal security in its defence budget, further investments and deployment of intrusive technologies for effective surveillance and ethnic sorting are gravely concerning. Furthermore, the differences in how each state employs surveillance technologies and associated human rights issues will further widen the ideological gap between the western liberal international order and the nationalistic ambitions of the Chinese communist party.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Secondly, with the state embracing AI technologies with increasing speed and scale, the imminent indigenous innovation and technological self-sufficiency make the exercise of an aggressive foreign policy more expedient. In general, the ambitions of fragile and autocratic regimes to deploy mass surveillance are often hindered by the low level of domestic technological capabilities, thereby urging these regimes to get into international collaborations30. China&rsquo;s Belt Road Initiative (and a Digital Silk Road) becomes crucial here. With the entry of state-backed Chinese companies into the European and African markets, the export of security technologies is imminent31. As of 2018, thirty-six BRI countries have incorporated significant AI surveillance technologies for their domestic governance. In export technologies &ndash; mainly for smart city platforms, facial recognition systems, and smart policing - China is now the leading supplier of AI surveillance technology, according to the AI Global Surveillance Index32. The increasing export of these technologies can also lead to the adoption of CPC&rsquo;s practices for social and political control across states33. For instance, avowing effective public diplomacy, China trains Latin American and African journalists to utilise emerging technologies for their professions. These exports and training programmes influence include a vast number of actors that tend to form a &lsquo;security-industrial complex&rsquo; where private companies along with the MPS are progressively becoming responsible for the export of surveillance goods34.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In sum, we see that China&rsquo;s grand strategy of &lsquo;social stability and enduring peace&rsquo; is sought through an authoritarian flavour of digital entrenchment. China&rsquo;s informatisation and surveillance backbone is the big data-driven large-scale deployment of machine learning algorithms, AI, facial recognition technologies, and other sophisticated technologies backed by an intelligent infrastructure35. As discussed, AI technologies may appear to remedy regime&rsquo;s insecurity and as an efficient tool for social governance. This being said, nation-states should be cautious with their technological collaborations with China. The diffusion of AI-based surveillance power into society will not only distort democratic ideals but will also escalate geopolitical risks at an unprecedented and uncontrollable scale.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sruthi Kalyani is a research scholar at the Centre of East Asian Studies (Chinese Studies Division), School of International Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.

This trend has further intensified since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with states such as China having justified invasive and sophisticated forms of AI-powered surveillance for the sake of public health management. As Katherine Mason 1 has observed, China\'s epidemic management mechanism exhibits a \'permanent and intractable bifurcation of service and governance\' that not only leads to various ethical challenges but also closes the opportunities for the outside world to scrutinise the dire realities happening within the boundaries of the party-state.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hence, what we see is a state that comes with the intention of \'social governance\' but then transmutes itself into a surveillance state where the promises of governance are framed within coercive procedures of social control. The \'prevention and control\' (fangkong) doctrine that has been officially followed for handling previous public health crises in China since the SARS epidemic of 20032, remains instrumental for tackling the ongoing \'people&rsquo;s war&rsquo; against COVID-193. &nbsp; The &lsquo;prevention and control&rsquo; system thus in place is also increasingly being utilised for resolving political risks, tightening public security, and maintaining social stability4.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Amidst more informatised and intelligent forms of surveillance and control, especially when these technologies are widely exported, the geopolitical implications are worrisome. With these concerns, this issue brief attempts to study and analyse the consequences of China&rsquo;s &lsquo;intelligentised social governance&rsquo;. The brief is divided into two sections - the first section outlines the development of China&rsquo;s surveillance mechanisms over the years, and the second section identifies certain geopolitical implications of China&rsquo;s digital authoritarianism and surveillance practices.</p>\r\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">The Rise of the Surveillance State</h1>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While various social management and surveillance mechanisms have been carried out in China for many years, the term &lsquo;intelligentisation of social governance&rsquo; finds its genesis in the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan (AIDP).

As of 2018, thirty-six BRI countries have incorporated significant AI surveillance technologies for their domestic governance. In export technologies &ndash; mainly for smart city platforms, facial recognition systems, and smart policing - China is now the leading supplier of AI surveillance technology, according to the AI Global Surveillance Index32. The increasing export of these technologies can also lead to the adoption of CPC&rsquo;s practices for social and political control across states33. For instance, avowing effective public diplomacy, China trains Latin American and African journalists to utilise emerging technologies for their professions. These exports and training programmes influence include a vast number of actors that tend to form a &lsquo;security-industrial complex&rsquo; where private companies along with the MPS are progressively becoming responsible for the export of surveillance goods34.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In sum, we see that China&rsquo;s grand strategy of &lsquo;social stability and enduring peace&rsquo; is sought through an authoritarian flavour of digital entrenchment.

As discussed, AI technologies may appear to remedy regime&rsquo;s insecurity and as an efficient tool for social governance. This being said, nation-states should be cautious with their technological collaborations with China.

This trend has further intensified since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with states such as China having justified invasive and sophisticated forms of AI-powered surveillance for the sake of public health management. As Katherine Mason 1 has observed, China\'s epidemic management mechanism exhibits a \'permanent and intractable bifurcation of service and governance\' that not only leads to various ethical challenges but also closes the opportunities for the outside world to scrutinise the dire realities happening within the boundaries of the party-state.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hence, what we see is a state that comes with the intention of \'social governance\' but then transmutes itself into a surveillance state where the promises of governance are framed within coercive procedures of social control. The \'prevention and control\' (fangkong) doctrine that has been officially followed for handling previous public health crises in China since the SARS epidemic of 20032, remains instrumental for tackling the ongoing \'people&rsquo;s war&rsquo; against COVID-193. &nbsp; The &lsquo;prevention and control&rsquo; system thus in place is also increasingly being utilised for resolving political risks, tightening public security, and maintaining social stability4.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Amidst more informatised and intelligent forms of surveillance and control, especially when these technologies are widely exported, the geopolitical implications are worrisome. With these concerns, this issue brief attempts to study and analyse the consequences of China&rsquo;s &lsquo;intelligentised social governance&rsquo;. The brief is divided into two sections - the first section outlines the development of China&rsquo;s surveillance mechanisms over the years, and the second section identifies certain geopolitical implications of China&rsquo;s digital authoritarianism and surveillance practices.</p>\r\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">The Rise of the Surveillance State</h1>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While various social management and surveillance mechanisms have been carried out in China for many years, the term &lsquo;intelligentisation of social governance&rsquo; finds its genesis in the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan (AIDP). In July 2017, for building China&rsquo;s first-mover advantage in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the State Council announced the AIDP 5 . Alongside various targets, it envisaged the construction&nbsp; of a &lsquo;safe and convenient</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1 Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, Vintage, 1979</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">intelligent society&rsquo; and modernised &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; (shehui zhili) via the use of AI-enabled high-quality services in areas of governance such as administrative management, judicial management, urban management, and so on6. The document observes the need for an intelligent infrastructure powered by collaborative AI, big data and high-performance computing to significantly elevate capabilities to effectively &lsquo;construct governance&rsquo; for maintaining societal stability. Whilst party control over the public and public information for constructing governance has been practised for a long time throughout the communist party regime, particular leadership changes have effectuated certain distinct forms of surveillance and control in practice. Despite the promise of governance aimed at guidance rather than control by providing more responsibilities to the civil societies and market forces7, Hoffman and Mattis8 note that &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; that is being practised in the Xi Jinping era under the aegis of the State Security Committee has more centralising tendencies than the &lsquo;social management&rsquo; (shehui guanli) that was followed in the Hu Jintao era. The shift towards social governance to &lsquo;strengthen leadership by the Party committee&rsquo; and a &lsquo;leading role of the government9&rsquo; is significant to observe for the rise of the surveillance state, especially when it is increasingly equipping itself with high-tech tools to govern. Understanding the evolution of surveillance policy is essential to gauge the increasing presence of the Chinese surveillance state in people&rsquo;s socio-political lives today.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 1996, the State Council issued Order No. 95 for the &ldquo;Management of Computer Information Networks hooked up with International Networks&rdquo; that paved the initial path towards establishing the state&rsquo;s managerial power over its internet users through &ldquo;unified planning, unified standards, and separation of management at different levels&rdquo; 10. In 2000, after the Golden Shield Project (jindun gongcheng) was envisaged, China&rsquo;s internet, protected by the Great Firewall, was practically made into an intranet within its territory. The state tracked and censored controversial political opinions and online dissidents through this. It strengthened the state&rsquo;s internet censorship and allowed private players to provide data-driven solutions for the surveillance project.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thus, the Golden Shield Project was seen as a significant change from a generalised control of online content towards individualised user surveillance and automated information sharing11. It brought forth integrated information platforms (zonghe xinxi pingtai) and a four-tiered security network (gongan wang) that connected the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) with its local governance bureaus, thereby creating a unified command over police work12. It was only in 2013, after the establishment of the Cyberspace Administration Commission, the complete and centralised control of the state&rsquo;s internet entirely materialised. The Great Firewall now uses robust AI monitoring and filtering mechanisms to control social movements and people&rsquo;s mobilisation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another tool of the state&rsquo;s social management is the grassroots-level monitoring of the grid management system (wanggehua guanli) that became operational in some cities as early as 2004. Through a &lsquo;system of contracted responsibility&rsquo; (chengbao zeren zhi), cities were divided into basic &lsquo;management units of digital city&rsquo;, and information of residents and migrant workers was</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">collected for policing at the established grid levels13. With the goal of stability maintenance, the grid management system employs invasive approaches to gather citizen information. With more technologies assisting the data gathering and grid monitoring processes, the party-state has established encompassing top-down management of public security14. Besides grid management, to encourage innovation in the &lsquo;dynamic management of social conflicts&rsquo; and public opinion influence, the State Council issued guiding opinions on social management innovation&rsquo; in 2011. Through these opinions, the party fostered and invested in intermediary civil society organisations that promised to engage in the vision of stability maintenance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Intending to make China a &ldquo;strong internet power&rdquo;, the 12th Five Year Plan as well as the &ldquo;Internet Plus&rdquo; strategy of 2011, have led to increasing investments in the emerging fields of big data and Internet of Things (IoT). Consequently, such investments have enabled the state to create big data algorithms for the project of social surveillance, yet again. One such major development is the Social Credit System (shehui xinyong) which was first proposed in 201415. Based on big-data algorithms, this system evaluates a Chinese citizen\'s &ldquo;social trustworthiness&rdquo;. It is expected to cover all of the 1.4 billion Chinese citizens by 2022. The social credit system comes not only as a tool to evaluate the financial trustworthiness of the citizens but it also enables the technology- driven implementation of &ldquo;responsibility mechanisms&rdquo; and a simultaneous social control<sup>16</sup>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The involvement of private companies in the implementation of this project has further strengthened the technological infrastructures on which state surveillance is carried out 17 . Guidelines and warnings regarding the &ldquo;trustworthiness&rdquo; of citizens have been released since the rollout of the social credit system. Various documents and regulations released by the CPC (Communist Party of China)&rsquo;s Central Committee such as the &lsquo;Rongcheng Municipal Measures on Personal Credit Rewards and Punishments&rsquo;2, provincial regulations such as the &lsquo;Guangdong Provincial Social Credit Regulations&rsquo;3, and warning documents such as &lsquo;Warning and Punishment Mechanisms for Trust-Breakers&rsquo;, and more, imply the state&rsquo;s intentions of not only monitoring but also modifying the behavioural preferences and the conduct of its citizens. With AI-driven technologies and innovative prevention and control systems, the mechanisms of social governance are ubiquitously engrained into the daily lives of Chinese citizens. Hence, this is a notable shift from the yesteryears of &lsquo;management&rsquo; and maintenance of social stability.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Chinese tech-enabled surveillance reached its heights upon the implementation of the &lsquo;Sharp Eyes&rsquo; (xueliang) project in 2015. This project aimed at achieving complete coverage and &ldquo;full control&rdquo; of all of China&rsquo;s public areas by 202018. As a measure, the Ministry of Public Security called for a &ldquo;fully networked and fully controllable&rdquo; national video surveillance network. The ministry also instructed the nationwide &lsquo;Police Cloud&rsquo; project envisaging integrated gathering of</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2 For Translation, see - <a href=\"https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-punishment-measures/\">https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-</a> <a href=\"https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-punishment-measures/\">punishment-measures/</a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3 For Translation, see - <a href=\"https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/guandong-provincial-social-credit/\">https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/guandong-provincial-social-credit/</a></p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">four types of data: public security professional data, government department management data, public service agency business data, and Internet data 19.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The data thus gathered from citizens are as sensitively personal as their medical records, transaction histories with e-commerce companies, travel histories, etc.20. It is estimated that by the end of 2021, the total number of surveillance cameras will grow beyond 400 million &ndash; amounting to approximately one camera for every three citizens21. This shows that the extent of surveillance is on the rise in China. Furthermore, to enable joint work of such projects and to legitimise the proliferation of private technologies for the state&rsquo;s use, the National Intelligence Law of 2017 purported to &ldquo;unify and centralise&rdquo; intelligence systems 22 . Through this legislation, private companies are mandated for assisting and cooperating with the state&rsquo;s intelligence network.

It comes with the blatantly pretentious promise of &ldquo;scientific decision-making&rdquo; towards public healthcare, poverty alleviation, and indeed, the maintenance of social stability.

This list included more state-run media outlets which highlights further that the information that is circulated in the country will be monitored by the State. The reason given by the Chinese officials for this updated list was that media outlets were no longer meeting the requirements and have poor daily influence.

China blocks many foreign websites, including Facebook, Instagram, and some Google services; still, the Chinese public has found ways to circumvent the so-called Great Firewall. The four major national networks, namely CSTNET, ChinaNet, CERNET and CHINAGBN, are the \"backbone\" of the mainland Chinese internet and ultimately seek to further the CCP\'s maintenance of the \'Great Firewall\'.

While the CCP maintains strict control over limiting any potential criticism of its practices, Weibo still emerges as a platform where citizens voice concerns over certain policies (in quickly censored posts). For instance, recent CiCM reports have covered instances of women voicing criticism of the <a href=\"https://orcasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/25.11.21-1.pdf\">one-child policy</a> and discussions over disco-</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">-<a href=\"https://orcasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23.11.21.pdf\">ntent </a>vis-a-vis the marriage leave system.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite such brief examples, such List(s) by the Chinese government raise serious threats to the quality of journalistic practices in the country and how that will shape up in the coming future.

As Katherine Mason 1 has observed, China\'s epidemic management mechanism exhibits a \'permanent and intractable bifurcation of service and governance\' that not only leads to various ethical challenges but also closes the opportunities for the outside world to scrutinise the dire realities happening within the boundaries of the party-state.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hence, what we see is a state that comes with the intention of \'social governance\' but then transmutes itself into a surveillance state where the promises of governance are framed within coercive procedures of social control. The \'prevention and control\' (fangkong) doctrine that has been officially followed for handling previous public health crises in China since the SARS epidemic of 20032, remains instrumental for tackling the ongoing \'people&rsquo;s war&rsquo; against COVID-193. &nbsp; The &lsquo;prevention and control&rsquo; system thus in place is also increasingly being utilised for resolving political risks, tightening public security, and maintaining social stability4.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Amidst more informatised and intelligent forms of surveillance and control, especially when these technologies are widely exported, the geopolitical implications are worrisome. With these concerns, this issue brief attempts to study and analyse the consequences of China&rsquo;s &lsquo;intelligentised social governance&rsquo;. The brief is divided into two sections - the first section outlines the development of China&rsquo;s surveillance mechanisms over the years, and the second section identifies certain geopolitical implications of China&rsquo;s digital authoritarianism and surveillance practices.</p>\r\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">The Rise of the Surveillance State</h1>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While various social management and surveillance mechanisms have been carried out in China for many years, the term &lsquo;intelligentisation of social governance&rsquo; finds its genesis in the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan (AIDP). In July 2017, for building China&rsquo;s first-mover advantage in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the State Council announced the AIDP 5 . Alongside various targets, it envisaged the construction&nbsp; of a &lsquo;safe and convenient</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1 Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, Vintage, 1979</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">intelligent society&rsquo; and modernised &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; (shehui zhili) via the use of AI-enabled high-quality services in areas of governance such as administrative management, judicial management, urban management, and so on6. The document observes the need for an intelligent infrastructure powered by collaborative AI, big data and high-performance computing to significantly elevate capabilities to effectively &lsquo;construct governance&rsquo; for maintaining societal stability. Whilst party control over the public and public information for constructing governance has been practised for a long time throughout the communist party regime, particular leadership changes have effectuated certain distinct forms of surveillance and control in practice. Despite the promise of governance aimed at guidance rather than control by providing more responsibilities to the civil societies and market forces7, Hoffman and Mattis8 note that &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; that is being practised in the Xi Jinping era under the aegis of the State Security Committee has more centralising tendencies than the &lsquo;social management&rsquo; (shehui guanli) that was followed in the Hu Jintao era. The shift towards social governance to &lsquo;strengthen leadership by the Party committee&rsquo; and a &lsquo;leading role of the government9&rsquo; is significant to observe for the rise of the surveillance state, especially when it is increasingly equipping itself with high-tech tools to govern. Understanding the evolution of surveillance policy is essential to gauge the increasing presence of the Chinese surveillance state in people&rsquo;s socio-political lives today.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 1996, the State Council issued Order No. 95 for the &ldquo;Management of Computer Information Networks hooked up with International Networks&rdquo; that paved the initial path towards establishing the state&rsquo;s managerial power over its internet users through &ldquo;unified planning, unified standards, and separation of management at different levels&rdquo; 10. In 2000, after the Golden Shield Project (jindun gongcheng) was envisaged, China&rsquo;s internet, protected by the Great Firewall, was practically made into an intranet within its territory. The state tracked and censored controversial political opinions and online dissidents through this. It strengthened the state&rsquo;s internet censorship and allowed private players to provide data-driven solutions for the surveillance project.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thus, the Golden Shield Project was seen as a significant change from a generalised control of online content towards individualised user surveillance and automated information sharing11. It brought forth integrated information platforms (zonghe xinxi pingtai) and a four-tiered security network (gongan wang) that connected the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) with its local governance bureaus, thereby creating a unified command over police work12. It was only in 2013, after the establishment of the Cyberspace Administration Commission, the complete and centralised control of the state&rsquo;s internet entirely materialised. The Great Firewall now uses robust AI monitoring and filtering mechanisms to control social movements and people&rsquo;s mobilisation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another tool of the state&rsquo;s social management is the grassroots-level monitoring of the grid management system (wanggehua guanli) that became operational in some cities as early as 2004. Through a &lsquo;system of contracted responsibility&rsquo; (chengbao zeren zhi), cities were divided into basic &lsquo;management units of digital city&rsquo;, and information of residents and migrant workers was</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">collected for policing at the established grid levels13. With the goal of stability maintenance, the grid management system employs invasive approaches to gather citizen information. With more technologies assisting the data gathering and grid monitoring processes, the party-state has established encompassing top-down management of public security14. Besides grid management, to encourage innovation in the &lsquo;dynamic management of social conflicts&rsquo; and public opinion influence, the State Council issued guiding opinions on social management innovation&rsquo; in 2011. Through these opinions, the party fostered and invested in intermediary civil society organisations that promised to engage in the vision of stability maintenance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Intending to make China a &ldquo;strong internet power&rdquo;, the 12th Five Year Plan as well as the &ldquo;Internet Plus&rdquo; strategy of 2011, have led to increasing investments in the emerging fields of big data and Internet of Things (IoT). Consequently, such investments have enabled the state to create big data algorithms for the project of social surveillance, yet again. One such major development is the Social Credit System (shehui xinyong) which was first proposed in 201415. Based on big-data algorithms, this system evaluates a Chinese citizen\'s &ldquo;social trustworthiness&rdquo;. It is expected to cover all of the 1.4 billion Chinese citizens by 2022. The social credit system comes not only as a tool to evaluate the financial trustworthiness of the citizens but it also enables the technology- driven implementation of &ldquo;responsibility mechanisms&rdquo; and a simultaneous social control<sup>16</sup>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The involvement of private companies in the implementation of this project has further strengthened the technological infrastructures on which state surveillance is carried out 17 . Guidelines and warnings regarding the &ldquo;trustworthiness&rdquo; of citizens have been released since the rollout of the social credit system. Various documents and regulations released by the CPC (Communist Party of China)&rsquo;s Central Committee such as the &lsquo;Rongcheng Municipal Measures on Personal Credit Rewards and Punishments&rsquo;2, provincial regulations such as the &lsquo;Guangdong Provincial Social Credit Regulations&rsquo;3, and warning documents such as &lsquo;Warning and Punishment Mechanisms for Trust-Breakers&rsquo;, and more, imply the state&rsquo;s intentions of not only monitoring but also modifying the behavioural preferences and the conduct of its citizens. With AI-driven technologies and innovative prevention and control systems, the mechanisms of social governance are ubiquitously engrained into the daily lives of Chinese citizens. Hence, this is a notable shift from the yesteryears of &lsquo;management&rsquo; and maintenance of social stability.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Chinese tech-enabled surveillance reached its heights upon the implementation of the &lsquo;Sharp Eyes&rsquo; (xueliang) project in 2015. This project aimed at achieving complete coverage and &ldquo;full control&rdquo; of all of China&rsquo;s public areas by 202018. As a measure, the Ministry of Public Security called for a &ldquo;fully networked and fully controllable&rdquo; national video surveillance network. The ministry also instructed the nationwide &lsquo;Police Cloud&rsquo; project envisaging integrated gathering of</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2 For Translation, see - <a href=\"https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-punishment-measures/\">https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-</a> <a href=\"https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-punishment-measures/\">punishment-measures/</a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3 For Translation, see - <a href=\"https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/guandong-provincial-social-credit/\">https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/guandong-provincial-social-credit/</a></p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">four types of data: public security professional data, government department management data, public service agency business data, and Internet data 19.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The data thus gathered from citizens are as sensitively personal as their medical records, transaction histories with e-commerce companies, travel histories, etc.20. It is estimated that by the end of 2021, the total number of surveillance cameras will grow beyond 400 million &ndash; amounting to approximately one camera for every three citizens21. This shows that the extent of surveillance is on the rise in China. Furthermore, to enable joint work of such projects and to legitimise the proliferation of private technologies for the state&rsquo;s use, the National Intelligence Law of 2017 purported to &ldquo;unify and centralise&rdquo; intelligence systems 22 . Through this legislation, private companies are mandated for assisting and cooperating with the state&rsquo;s intelligence network. In 2018, The white paper on AI Security released by the Chinese Academy for Information Technology recommended public opinion monitoring and &lsquo;automating&rsquo; social governance, acknowledging the substantial role of private companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu in the implementation of the intelligentisation of social governance23.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Above all, some provinces\' surveillance intentions and procedures are more alarming than others, Xinjiang being the palpable reality. While predictive policing systems across the globe unduly harm ethnic minorities, and that racial bias is becoming disturbingly common, the practice of bio- metric surveillance in Xinjiang is a peculiar case. It comes with the blatantly pretentious promise of &ldquo;scientific decision-making&rdquo; towards public healthcare, poverty alleviation, and indeed, the maintenance of social stability. The &lsquo;Physicals for All&rsquo; programme that was launched in 2017 for the sake of &ldquo;national health examination work&rdquo; in Xinjiang24, forcibly collected blood samples and biometric details of the region&rsquo;s residents to create a DNA databank25. Being the first state to employ AI for racial profiling26, China&rsquo;s policies towards the Uyghur Muslims are undoubtedly driven by &lsquo;algorithms of repression&rsquo;. Mass surveillance in Xinjiang is conducted through the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP) that deploys &ldquo;wifi sniffers&rdquo;, machine sensors, and other sophisticated facial recognition technologies to monitor, store, and manage residents&rsquo; activities27. All the extracted data is localised within the domestic territory. For the Chinese state, the IJOP is a technological solution devised to &ldquo;inquire, investigate and thoroughly sort&rdquo; the ideological and familial issues of the population28. To target the Muslim minorities, mosques are labelled as &ldquo;high-risk&rdquo; areas and are monitored through real-time video. For striking hard against terrorism and Islamic extremism, the state utilises high-tech surveillance to vigil day-to-day activities, and profiles certain religious and cultural practices as &ldquo;pre-crimes&rdquo;. Ironically, at a time when such systems are systematically well-deployed and functioning, China has signed the United Nations&rsquo; pledge on banning AI for social scoring systems4.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">4 For further details, read UNESCO&rsquo;s draft text of the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Intelligence - https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379920.page=14</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">Concerns and Implications</h1>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite the sanguine possibilities portrayed by the party-state in the name of &lsquo;surveilling and serving&rsquo;, it is foreseeable that AI technologies will make authoritarianism more sustainable, at the least in the medium term29. Domestically, we see that public opinion is controlled and manipulated through automated internet censorship. Additionally, AI-powered technological ownership will enable Chairman Xi Jinping to assert more power and control over the party elites. In the international context, there are several consequences.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Firstly, the normalisation of mass surveillance systems and the state-enforced silences in the name of &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; are catastrophic to the imaginaries of individual civil liberties. The human rights issue is the primary problem, evidently seen in the covert and coercive monitoring mechanisms in the Xinjiang and Tibet Autonomous Regions. Severe incursions on reproductive rights of ethnic minorities (such as the campaigns against &lsquo;illegal births&rsquo;), their right to language and religion, and more importantly, their right to live together as a household are all devastatingly controlled by tech-intensive methods of digital enclosures. Given that China spends substantially more on internal security in its defence budget, further investments and deployment of intrusive technologies for effective surveillance and ethnic sorting are gravely concerning. Furthermore, the differences in how each state employs surveillance technologies and associated human rights issues will further widen the ideological gap between the western liberal international order and the nationalistic ambitions of the Chinese communist party.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Secondly, with the state embracing AI technologies with increasing speed and scale, the imminent indigenous innovation and technological self-sufficiency make the exercise of an aggressive foreign policy more expedient. In general, the ambitions of fragile and autocratic regimes to deploy mass surveillance are often hindered by the low level of domestic technological capabilities, thereby urging these regimes to get into international collaborations30. China&rsquo;s Belt Road Initiative (and a Digital Silk Road) becomes crucial here. With the entry of state-backed Chinese companies into the European and African markets, the export of security technologies is imminent31. As of 2018, thirty-six BRI countries have incorporated significant AI surveillance technologies for their domestic governance. In export technologies &ndash; mainly for smart city platforms, facial recognition systems, and smart policing - China is now the leading supplier of AI surveillance technology, according to the AI Global Surveillance Index32. The increasing export of these technologies can also lead to the adoption of CPC&rsquo;s practices for social and political control across states33. For instance, avowing effective public diplomacy, China trains Latin American and African journalists to utilise emerging technologies for their professions. These exports and training programmes influence include a vast number of actors that tend to form a &lsquo;security-industrial complex&rsquo; where private companies along with the MPS are progressively becoming responsible for the export of surveillance goods34.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In sum, we see that China&rsquo;s grand strategy of &lsquo;social stability and enduring peace&rsquo; is sought through an authoritarian flavour of digital entrenchment. China&rsquo;s informatisation and surveillance backbone is the big data-driven large-scale deployment of machine learning algorithms, AI, facial recognition technologies, and other sophisticated technologies backed by an intelligent infrastructure35. As discussed, AI technologies may appear to remedy regime&rsquo;s insecurity and as an efficient tool for social governance. This being said, nation-states should be cautious with their technological collaborations with China. The diffusion of AI-based surveillance power into society will not only distort democratic ideals but will also escalate geopolitical risks at an unprecedented and uncontrollable scale.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sruthi Kalyani is a research scholar at the Centre of East Asian Studies (Chinese Studies Division), School of International Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.

This trend has further intensified since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with states such as China having justified invasive and sophisticated forms of AI-powered surveillance for the sake of public health management. As Katherine Mason 1 has observed, China\'s epidemic management mechanism exhibits a \'permanent and intractable bifurcation of service and governance\' that not only leads to various ethical challenges but also closes the opportunities for the outside world to scrutinise the dire realities happening within the boundaries of the party-state.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hence, what we see is a state that comes with the intention of \'social governance\' but then transmutes itself into a surveillance state where the promises of governance are framed within coercive procedures of social control. The \'prevention and control\' (fangkong) doctrine that has been officially followed for handling previous public health crises in China since the SARS epidemic of 20032, remains instrumental for tackling the ongoing \'people&rsquo;s war&rsquo; against COVID-193. &nbsp; The &lsquo;prevention and control&rsquo; system thus in place is also increasingly being utilised for resolving political risks, tightening public security, and maintaining social stability4.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Amidst more informatised and intelligent forms of surveillance and control, especially when these technologies are widely exported, the geopolitical implications are worrisome. With these concerns, this issue brief attempts to study and analyse the consequences of China&rsquo;s &lsquo;intelligentised social governance&rsquo;. The brief is divided into two sections - the first section outlines the development of China&rsquo;s surveillance mechanisms over the years, and the second section identifies certain geopolitical implications of China&rsquo;s digital authoritarianism and surveillance practices.</p>\r\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">The Rise of the Surveillance State</h1>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While various social management and surveillance mechanisms have been carried out in China for many years, the term &lsquo;intelligentisation of social governance&rsquo; finds its genesis in the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan (AIDP). In July 2017, for building China&rsquo;s first-mover advantage in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the State Council announced the AIDP 5 . Alongside various targets, it envisaged the construction&nbsp; of a &lsquo;safe and convenient</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1 Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, Vintage, 1979</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">intelligent society&rsquo; and modernised &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; (shehui zhili) via the use of AI-enabled high-quality services in areas of governance such as administrative management, judicial management, urban management, and so on6. The document observes the need for an intelligent infrastructure powered by collaborative AI, big data and high-performance computing to significantly elevate capabilities to effectively &lsquo;construct governance&rsquo; for maintaining societal stability. Whilst party control over the public and public information for constructing governance has been practised for a long time throughout the communist party regime, particular leadership changes have effectuated certain distinct forms of surveillance and control in practice. Despite the promise of governance aimed at guidance rather than control by providing more responsibilities to the civil societies and market forces7, Hoffman and Mattis8 note that &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; that is being practised in the Xi Jinping era under the aegis of the State Security Committee has more centralising tendencies than the &lsquo;social management&rsquo; (shehui guanli) that was followed in the Hu Jintao era. The shift towards social governance to &lsquo;strengthen leadership by the Party committee&rsquo; and a &lsquo;leading role of the government9&rsquo; is significant to observe for the rise of the surveillance state, especially when it is increasingly equipping itself with high-tech tools to govern. Understanding the evolution of surveillance policy is essential to gauge the increasing presence of the Chinese surveillance state in people&rsquo;s socio-political lives today.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 1996, the State Council issued Order No. 95 for the &ldquo;Management of Computer Information Networks hooked up with International Networks&rdquo; that paved the initial path towards establishing the state&rsquo;s managerial power over its internet users through &ldquo;unified planning, unified standards, and separation of management at different levels&rdquo; 10. In 2000, after the Golden Shield Project (jindun gongcheng) was envisaged, China&rsquo;s internet, protected by the Great Firewall, was practically made into an intranet within its territory. The state tracked and censored controversial political opinions and online dissidents through this. It strengthened the state&rsquo;s internet censorship and allowed private players to provide data-driven solutions for the surveillance project.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thus, the Golden Shield Project was seen as a significant change from a generalised control of online content towards individualised user surveillance and automated information sharing11. It brought forth integrated information platforms (zonghe xinxi pingtai) and a four-tiered security network (gongan wang) that connected the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) with its local governance bureaus, thereby creating a unified command over police work12. It was only in 2013, after the establishment of the Cyberspace Administration Commission, the complete and centralised control of the state&rsquo;s internet entirely materialised. The Great Firewall now uses robust AI monitoring and filtering mechanisms to control social movements and people&rsquo;s mobilisation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another tool of the state&rsquo;s social management is the grassroots-level monitoring of the grid management system (wanggehua guanli) that became operational in some cities as early as 2004. Through a &lsquo;system of contracted responsibility&rsquo; (chengbao zeren zhi), cities were divided into basic &lsquo;management units of digital city&rsquo;, and information of residents and migrant workers was</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">collected for policing at the established grid levels13. With the goal of stability maintenance, the grid management system employs invasive approaches to gather citizen information. With more technologies assisting the data gathering and grid monitoring processes, the party-state has established encompassing top-down management of public security14. Besides grid management, to encourage innovation in the &lsquo;dynamic management of social conflicts&rsquo; and public opinion influence, the State Council issued guiding opinions on social management innovation&rsquo; in 2011. Through these opinions, the party fostered and invested in intermediary civil society organisations that promised to engage in the vision of stability maintenance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Intending to make China a &ldquo;strong internet power&rdquo;, the 12th Five Year Plan as well as the &ldquo;Internet Plus&rdquo; strategy of 2011, have led to increasing investments in the emerging fields of big data and Internet of Things (IoT). Consequently, such investments have enabled the state to create big data algorithms for the project of social surveillance, yet again. One such major development is the Social Credit System (shehui xinyong) which was first proposed in 201415. Based on big-data algorithms, this system evaluates a Chinese citizen\'s &ldquo;social trustworthiness&rdquo;. It is expected to cover all of the 1.4 billion Chinese citizens by 2022. The social credit system comes not only as a tool to evaluate the financial trustworthiness of the citizens but it also enables the technology- driven implementation of &ldquo;responsibility mechanisms&rdquo; and a simultaneous social control<sup>16</sup>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The involvement of private companies in the implementation of this project has further strengthened the technological infrastructures on which state surveillance is carried out 17 . Guidelines and warnings regarding the &ldquo;trustworthiness&rdquo; of citizens have been released since the rollout of the social credit system. Various documents and regulations released by the CPC (Communist Party of China)&rsquo;s Central Committee such as the &lsquo;Rongcheng Municipal Measures on Personal Credit Rewards and Punishments&rsquo;2, provincial regulations such as the &lsquo;Guangdong Provincial Social Credit Regulations&rsquo;3, and warning documents such as &lsquo;Warning and Punishment Mechanisms for Trust-Breakers&rsquo;, and more, imply the state&rsquo;s intentions of not only monitoring but also modifying the behavioural preferences and the conduct of its citizens. With AI-driven technologies and innovative prevention and control systems, the mechanisms of social governance are ubiquitously engrained into the daily lives of Chinese citizens. Hence, this is a notable shift from the yesteryears of &lsquo;management&rsquo; and maintenance of social stability.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Chinese tech-enabled surveillance reached its heights upon the implementation of the &lsquo;Sharp Eyes&rsquo; (xueliang) project in 2015.

With these concerns, this issue brief attempts to study and analyse the consequences of China&rsquo;s &lsquo;intelligentised social governance&rsquo;. The brief is divided into two sections - the first section outlines the development of China&rsquo;s surveillance mechanisms over the years, and the second section identifies certain geopolitical implications of China&rsquo;s digital authoritarianism and surveillance practices.</p>\r\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">The Rise of the Surveillance State</h1>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While various social management and surveillance mechanisms have been carried out in China for many years, the term &lsquo;intelligentisation of social governance&rsquo; finds its genesis in the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan (AIDP). In July 2017, for building China&rsquo;s first-mover advantage in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the State Council announced the AIDP 5 . Alongside various targets, it envisaged the construction&nbsp; of a &lsquo;safe and convenient</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1 Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, Vintage, 1979</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">intelligent society&rsquo; and modernised &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; (shehui zhili) via the use of AI-enabled high-quality services in areas of governance such as administrative management, judicial management, urban management, and so on6. The document observes the need for an intelligent infrastructure powered by collaborative AI, big data and high-performance computing to significantly elevate capabilities to effectively &lsquo;construct governance&rsquo; for maintaining societal stability. Whilst party control over the public and public information for constructing governance has been practised for a long time throughout the communist party regime, particular leadership changes have effectuated certain distinct forms of surveillance and control in practice. Despite the promise of governance aimed at guidance rather than control by providing more responsibilities to the civil societies and market forces7, Hoffman and Mattis8 note that &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; that is being practised in the Xi Jinping era under the aegis of the State Security Committee has more centralising tendencies than the &lsquo;social management&rsquo; (shehui guanli) that was followed in the Hu Jintao era. The shift towards social governance to &lsquo;strengthen leadership by the Party committee&rsquo; and a &lsquo;leading role of the government9&rsquo; is significant to observe for the rise of the surveillance state, especially when it is increasingly equipping itself with high-tech tools to govern. Understanding the evolution of surveillance policy is essential to gauge the increasing presence of the Chinese surveillance state in people&rsquo;s socio-political lives today.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 1996, the State Council issued Order No. 95 for the &ldquo;Management of Computer Information Networks hooked up with International Networks&rdquo; that paved the initial path towards establishing the state&rsquo;s managerial power over its internet users through &ldquo;unified planning, unified standards, and separation of management at different levels&rdquo; 10. In 2000, after the Golden Shield Project (jindun gongcheng) was envisaged, China&rsquo;s internet, protected by the Great Firewall, was practically made into an intranet within its territory. The state tracked and censored controversial political opinions and online dissidents through this. It strengthened the state&rsquo;s internet censorship and allowed private players to provide data-driven solutions for the surveillance project.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thus, the Golden Shield Project was seen as a significant change from a generalised control of online content towards individualised user surveillance and automated information sharing11. It brought forth integrated information platforms (zonghe xinxi pingtai) and a four-tiered security network (gongan wang) that connected the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) with its local governance bureaus, thereby creating a unified command over police work12. It was only in 2013, after the establishment of the Cyberspace Administration Commission, the complete and centralised control of the state&rsquo;s internet entirely materialised. The Great Firewall now uses robust AI monitoring and filtering mechanisms to control social movements and people&rsquo;s mobilisation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another tool of the state&rsquo;s social management is the grassroots-level monitoring of the grid management system (wanggehua guanli) that became operational in some cities as early as 2004. Through a &lsquo;system of contracted responsibility&rsquo; (chengbao zeren zhi), cities were divided into basic &lsquo;management units of digital city&rsquo;, and information of residents and migrant workers was</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">collected for policing at the established grid levels13. With the goal of stability maintenance, the grid management system employs invasive approaches to gather citizen information. With more technologies assisting the data gathering and grid monitoring processes, the party-state has established encompassing top-down management of public security14. Besides grid management, to encourage innovation in the &lsquo;dynamic management of social conflicts&rsquo; and public opinion influence, the State Council issued guiding opinions on social management innovation&rsquo; in 2011. Through these opinions, the party fostered and invested in intermediary civil society organisations that promised to engage in the vision of stability maintenance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Intending to make China a &ldquo;strong internet power&rdquo;, the 12th Five Year Plan as well as the &ldquo;Internet Plus&rdquo; strategy of 2011, have led to increasing investments in the emerging fields of big data and Internet of Things (IoT). Consequently, such investments have enabled the state to create big data algorithms for the project of social surveillance, yet again. One such major development is the Social Credit System (shehui xinyong) which was first proposed in 201415. Based on big-data algorithms, this system evaluates a Chinese citizen\'s &ldquo;social trustworthiness&rdquo;. It is expected to cover all of the 1.4 billion Chinese citizens by 2022. The social credit system comes not only as a tool to evaluate the financial trustworthiness of the citizens but it also enables the technology- driven implementation of &ldquo;responsibility mechanisms&rdquo; and a simultaneous social control<sup>16</sup>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The involvement of private companies in the implementation of this project has further strengthened the technological infrastructures on which state surveillance is carried out 17 . Guidelines and warnings regarding the &ldquo;trustworthiness&rdquo; of citizens have been released since the rollout of the social credit system. Various documents and regulations released by the CPC (Communist Party of China)&rsquo;s Central Committee such as the &lsquo;Rongcheng Municipal Measures on Personal Credit Rewards and Punishments&rsquo;2, provincial regulations such as the &lsquo;Guangdong Provincial Social Credit Regulations&rsquo;3, and warning documents such as &lsquo;Warning and Punishment Mechanisms for Trust-Breakers&rsquo;, and more, imply the state&rsquo;s intentions of not only monitoring but also modifying the behavioural preferences and the conduct of its citizens. With AI-driven technologies and innovative prevention and control systems, the mechanisms of social governance are ubiquitously engrained into the daily lives of Chinese citizens. Hence, this is a notable shift from the yesteryears of &lsquo;management&rsquo; and maintenance of social stability.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Chinese tech-enabled surveillance reached its heights upon the implementation of the &lsquo;Sharp Eyes&rsquo; (xueliang) project in 2015. This project aimed at achieving complete coverage and &ldquo;full control&rdquo; of all of China&rsquo;s public areas by 202018. As a measure, the Ministry of Public Security called for a &ldquo;fully networked and fully controllable&rdquo; national video surveillance network. The ministry also instructed the nationwide &lsquo;Police Cloud&rsquo; project envisaging integrated gathering of</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2 For Translation, see - <a href=\"https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-punishment-measures/\">https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-</a> <a href=\"https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-punishment-measures/\">punishment-measures/</a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3 For Translation, see - <a href=\"https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/guandong-provincial-social-credit/\">https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/guandong-provincial-social-credit/</a></p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">four types of data: public security professional data, government department management data, public service agency business data, and Internet data 19.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The data thus gathered from citizens are as sensitively personal as their medical records, transaction histories with e-commerce companies, travel histories, etc.20. It is estimated that by the end of 2021, the total number of surveillance cameras will grow beyond 400 million &ndash; amounting to approximately one camera for every three citizens21. This shows that the extent of surveillance is on the rise in China. Furthermore, to enable joint work of such projects and to legitimise the proliferation of private technologies for the state&rsquo;s use, the National Intelligence Law of 2017 purported to &ldquo;unify and centralise&rdquo; intelligence systems 22 . Through this legislation, private companies are mandated for assisting and cooperating with the state&rsquo;s intelligence network. In 2018, The white paper on AI Security released by the Chinese Academy for Information Technology recommended public opinion monitoring and &lsquo;automating&rsquo; social governance, acknowledging the substantial role of private companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu in the implementation of the intelligentisation of social governance23.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Above all, some provinces\' surveillance intentions and procedures are more alarming than others, Xinjiang being the palpable reality. While predictive policing systems across the globe unduly harm ethnic minorities, and that racial bias is becoming disturbingly common, the practice of bio- metric surveillance in Xinjiang is a peculiar case. It comes with the blatantly pretentious promise of &ldquo;scientific decision-making&rdquo; towards public healthcare, poverty alleviation, and indeed, the maintenance of social stability. The &lsquo;Physicals for All&rsquo; programme that was launched in 2017 for the sake of &ldquo;national health examination work&rdquo; in Xinjiang24, forcibly collected blood samples and biometric details of the region&rsquo;s residents to create a DNA databank25. Being the first state to employ AI for racial profiling26, China&rsquo;s policies towards the Uyghur Muslims are undoubtedly driven by &lsquo;algorithms of repression&rsquo;. Mass surveillance in Xinjiang is conducted through the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP) that deploys &ldquo;wifi sniffers&rdquo;, machine sensors, and other sophisticated facial recognition technologies to monitor, store, and manage residents&rsquo; activities27. All the extracted data is localised within the domestic territory. For the Chinese state, the IJOP is a technological solution devised to &ldquo;inquire, investigate and thoroughly sort&rdquo; the ideological and familial issues of the population28. To target the Muslim minorities, mosques are labelled as &ldquo;high-risk&rdquo; areas and are monitored through real-time video. For striking hard against terrorism and Islamic extremism, the state utilises high-tech surveillance to vigil day-to-day activities, and profiles certain religious and cultural practices as &ldquo;pre-crimes&rdquo;. Ironically, at a time when such systems are systematically well-deployed and functioning, China has signed the United Nations&rsquo; pledge on banning AI for social scoring systems4.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">4 For further details, read UNESCO&rsquo;s draft text of the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Intelligence - https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379920.page=14</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">Concerns and Implications</h1>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite the sanguine possibilities portrayed by the party-state in the name of &lsquo;surveilling and serving&rsquo;, it is foreseeable that AI technologies will make authoritarianism more sustainable, at the least in the medium term29. Domestically, we see that public opinion is controlled and manipulated through automated internet censorship. Additionally, AI-powered technological ownership will enable Chairman Xi Jinping to assert more power and control over the party elites. In the international context, there are several consequences.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Firstly, the normalisation of mass surveillance systems and the state-enforced silences in the name of &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; are catastrophic to the imaginaries of individual civil liberties. The human rights issue is the primary problem, evidently seen in the covert and coercive monitoring mechanisms in the Xinjiang and Tibet Autonomous Regions. Severe incursions on reproductive rights of ethnic minorities (such as the campaigns against &lsquo;illegal births&rsquo;), their right to language and religion, and more importantly, their right to live together as a household are all devastatingly controlled by tech-intensive methods of digital enclosures. Given that China spends substantially more on internal security in its defence budget, further investments and deployment of intrusive technologies for effective surveillance and ethnic sorting are gravely concerning. Furthermore, the differences in how each state employs surveillance technologies and associated human rights issues will further widen the ideological gap between the western liberal international order and the nationalistic ambitions of the Chinese communist party.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Secondly, with the state embracing AI technologies with increasing speed and scale, the imminent indigenous innovation and technological self-sufficiency make the exercise of an aggressive foreign policy more expedient. In general, the ambitions of fragile and autocratic regimes to deploy mass surveillance are often hindered by the low level of domestic technological capabilities, thereby urging these regimes to get into international collaborations30. China&rsquo;s Belt Road Initiative (and a Digital Silk Road) becomes crucial here. With the entry of state-backed Chinese companies into the European and African markets, the export of security technologies is imminent31. As of 2018, thirty-six BRI countries have incorporated significant AI surveillance technologies for their domestic governance. In export technologies &ndash; mainly for smart city platforms, facial recognition systems, and smart policing - China is now the leading supplier of AI surveillance technology, according to the AI Global Surveillance Index32. The increasing export of these technologies can also lead to the adoption of CPC&rsquo;s practices for social and political control across states33. For instance, avowing effective public diplomacy, China trains Latin American and African journalists to utilise emerging technologies for their professions. These exports and training programmes influence include a vast number of actors that tend to form a &lsquo;security-industrial complex&rsquo; where private companies along with the MPS are progressively becoming responsible for the export of surveillance goods34.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In sum, we see that China&rsquo;s grand strategy of &lsquo;social stability and enduring peace&rsquo; is sought through an authoritarian flavour of digital entrenchment. China&rsquo;s informatisation and surveillance backbone is the big data-driven large-scale deployment of machine learning algorithms, AI, facial recognition technologies, and other sophisticated technologies backed by an intelligent infrastructure35. As discussed, AI technologies may appear to remedy regime&rsquo;s insecurity and as an efficient tool for social governance. This being said, nation-states should be cautious with their technological collaborations with China. The diffusion of AI-based surveillance power into society will not only distort democratic ideals but will also escalate geopolitical risks at an unprecedented and uncontrollable scale.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sruthi Kalyani is a research scholar at the Centre of East Asian Studies (Chinese Studies Division), School of International Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.

The brief is divided into two sections - the first section outlines the development of China&rsquo;s surveillance mechanisms over the years, and the second section identifies certain geopolitical implications of China&rsquo;s digital authoritarianism and surveillance practices.</p>\r\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">The Rise of the Surveillance State</h1>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While various social management and surveillance mechanisms have been carried out in China for many years, the term &lsquo;intelligentisation of social governance&rsquo; finds its genesis in the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan (AIDP). In July 2017, for building China&rsquo;s first-mover advantage in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the State Council announced the AIDP 5 . Alongside various targets, it envisaged the construction&nbsp; of a &lsquo;safe and convenient</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1 Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, Vintage, 1979</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">intelligent society&rsquo; and modernised &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; (shehui zhili) via the use of AI-enabled high-quality services in areas of governance such as administrative management, judicial management, urban management, and so on6. The document observes the need for an intelligent infrastructure powered by collaborative AI, big data and high-performance computing to significantly elevate capabilities to effectively &lsquo;construct governance&rsquo; for maintaining societal stability. Whilst party control over the public and public information for constructing governance has been practised for a long time throughout the communist party regime, particular leadership changes have effectuated certain distinct forms of surveillance and control in practice. Despite the promise of governance aimed at guidance rather than control by providing more responsibilities to the civil societies and market forces7, Hoffman and Mattis8 note that &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; that is being practised in the Xi Jinping era under the aegis of the State Security Committee has more centralising tendencies than the &lsquo;social management&rsquo; (shehui guanli) that was followed in the Hu Jintao era. The shift towards social governance to &lsquo;strengthen leadership by the Party committee&rsquo; and a &lsquo;leading role of the government9&rsquo; is significant to observe for the rise of the surveillance state, especially when it is increasingly equipping itself with high-tech tools to govern. Understanding the evolution of surveillance policy is essential to gauge the increasing presence of the Chinese surveillance state in people&rsquo;s socio-political lives today.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 1996, the State Council issued Order No. 95 for the &ldquo;Management of Computer Information Networks hooked up with International Networks&rdquo; that paved the initial path towards establishing the state&rsquo;s managerial power over its internet users through &ldquo;unified planning, unified standards, and separation of management at different levels&rdquo; 10. In 2000, after the Golden Shield Project (jindun gongcheng) was envisaged, China&rsquo;s internet, protected by the Great Firewall, was practically made into an intranet within its territory. The state tracked and censored controversial political opinions and online dissidents through this. It strengthened the state&rsquo;s internet censorship and allowed private players to provide data-driven solutions for the surveillance project.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thus, the Golden Shield Project was seen as a significant change from a generalised control of online content towards individualised user surveillance and automated information sharing11. It brought forth integrated information platforms (zonghe xinxi pingtai) and a four-tiered security network (gongan wang) that connected the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) with its local governance bureaus, thereby creating a unified command over police work12. It was only in 2013, after the establishment of the Cyberspace Administration Commission, the complete and centralised control of the state&rsquo;s internet entirely materialised. The Great Firewall now uses robust AI monitoring and filtering mechanisms to control social movements and people&rsquo;s mobilisation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another tool of the state&rsquo;s social management is the grassroots-level monitoring of the grid management system (wanggehua guanli) that became operational in some cities as early as 2004. Through a &lsquo;system of contracted responsibility&rsquo; (chengbao zeren zhi), cities were divided into basic &lsquo;management units of digital city&rsquo;, and information of residents and migrant workers was</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">collected for policing at the established grid levels13. With the goal of stability maintenance, the grid management system employs invasive approaches to gather citizen information. With more technologies assisting the data gathering and grid monitoring processes, the party-state has established encompassing top-down management of public security14. Besides grid management, to encourage innovation in the &lsquo;dynamic management of social conflicts&rsquo; and public opinion influence, the State Council issued guiding opinions on social management innovation&rsquo; in 2011. Through these opinions, the party fostered and invested in intermediary civil society organisations that promised to engage in the vision of stability maintenance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Intending to make China a &ldquo;strong internet power&rdquo;, the 12th Five Year Plan as well as the &ldquo;Internet Plus&rdquo; strategy of 2011, have led to increasing investments in the emerging fields of big data and Internet of Things (IoT). Consequently, such investments have enabled the state to create big data algorithms for the project of social surveillance, yet again. One such major development is the Social Credit System (shehui xinyong) which was first proposed in 201415. Based on big-data algorithms, this system evaluates a Chinese citizen\'s &ldquo;social trustworthiness&rdquo;. It is expected to cover all of the 1.4 billion Chinese citizens by 2022. The social credit system comes not only as a tool to evaluate the financial trustworthiness of the citizens but it also enables the technology- driven implementation of &ldquo;responsibility mechanisms&rdquo; and a simultaneous social control<sup>16</sup>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The involvement of private companies in the implementation of this project has further strengthened the technological infrastructures on which state surveillance is carried out 17 . Guidelines and warnings regarding the &ldquo;trustworthiness&rdquo; of citizens have been released since the rollout of the social credit system. Various documents and regulations released by the CPC (Communist Party of China)&rsquo;s Central Committee such as the &lsquo;Rongcheng Municipal Measures on Personal Credit Rewards and Punishments&rsquo;2, provincial regulations such as the &lsquo;Guangdong Provincial Social Credit Regulations&rsquo;3, and warning documents such as &lsquo;Warning and Punishment Mechanisms for Trust-Breakers&rsquo;, and more, imply the state&rsquo;s intentions of not only monitoring but also modifying the behavioural preferences and the conduct of its citizens. With AI-driven technologies and innovative prevention and control systems, the mechanisms of social governance are ubiquitously engrained into the daily lives of Chinese citizens. Hence, this is a notable shift from the yesteryears of &lsquo;management&rsquo; and maintenance of social stability.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Chinese tech-enabled surveillance reached its heights upon the implementation of the &lsquo;Sharp Eyes&rsquo; (xueliang) project in 2015. This project aimed at achieving complete coverage and &ldquo;full control&rdquo; of all of China&rsquo;s public areas by 202018. As a measure, the Ministry of Public Security called for a &ldquo;fully networked and fully controllable&rdquo; national video surveillance network. The ministry also instructed the nationwide &lsquo;Police Cloud&rsquo; project envisaging integrated gathering of</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2 For Translation, see - <a href=\"https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-punishment-measures/\">https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-</a> <a href=\"https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-punishment-measures/\">punishment-measures/</a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3 For Translation, see - <a href=\"https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/guandong-provincial-social-credit/\">https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/guandong-provincial-social-credit/</a></p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">four types of data: public security professional data, government department management data, public service agency business data, and Internet data 19.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The data thus gathered from citizens are as sensitively personal as their medical records, transaction histories with e-commerce companies, travel histories, etc.20. It is estimated that by the end of 2021, the total number of surveillance cameras will grow beyond 400 million &ndash; amounting to approximately one camera for every three citizens21. This shows that the extent of surveillance is on the rise in China. Furthermore, to enable joint work of such projects and to legitimise the proliferation of private technologies for the state&rsquo;s use, the National Intelligence Law of 2017 purported to &ldquo;unify and centralise&rdquo; intelligence systems 22 . Through this legislation, private companies are mandated for assisting and cooperating with the state&rsquo;s intelligence network. In 2018, The white paper on AI Security released by the Chinese Academy for Information Technology recommended public opinion monitoring and &lsquo;automating&rsquo; social governance, acknowledging the substantial role of private companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu in the implementation of the intelligentisation of social governance23.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Above all, some provinces\' surveillance intentions and procedures are more alarming than others, Xinjiang being the palpable reality. While predictive policing systems across the globe unduly harm ethnic minorities, and that racial bias is becoming disturbingly common, the practice of bio- metric surveillance in Xinjiang is a peculiar case. It comes with the blatantly pretentious promise of &ldquo;scientific decision-making&rdquo; towards public healthcare, poverty alleviation, and indeed, the maintenance of social stability. The &lsquo;Physicals for All&rsquo; programme that was launched in 2017 for the sake of &ldquo;national health examination work&rdquo; in Xinjiang24, forcibly collected blood samples and biometric details of the region&rsquo;s residents to create a DNA databank25. Being the first state to employ AI for racial profiling26, China&rsquo;s policies towards the Uyghur Muslims are undoubtedly driven by &lsquo;algorithms of repression&rsquo;. Mass surveillance in Xinjiang is conducted through the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP) that deploys &ldquo;wifi sniffers&rdquo;, machine sensors, and other sophisticated facial recognition technologies to monitor, store, and manage residents&rsquo; activities27. All the extracted data is localised within the domestic territory. For the Chinese state, the IJOP is a technological solution devised to &ldquo;inquire, investigate and thoroughly sort&rdquo; the ideological and familial issues of the population28. To target the Muslim minorities, mosques are labelled as &ldquo;high-risk&rdquo; areas and are monitored through real-time video. For striking hard against terrorism and Islamic extremism, the state utilises high-tech surveillance to vigil day-to-day activities, and profiles certain religious and cultural practices as &ldquo;pre-crimes&rdquo;. Ironically, at a time when such systems are systematically well-deployed and functioning, China has signed the United Nations&rsquo; pledge on banning AI for social scoring systems4.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">4 For further details, read UNESCO&rsquo;s draft text of the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Intelligence - https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379920.page=14</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">Concerns and Implications</h1>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite the sanguine possibilities portrayed by the party-state in the name of &lsquo;surveilling and serving&rsquo;, it is foreseeable that AI technologies will make authoritarianism more sustainable, at the least in the medium term29. Domestically, we see that public opinion is controlled and manipulated through automated internet censorship. Additionally, AI-powered technological ownership will enable Chairman Xi Jinping to assert more power and control over the party elites. In the international context, there are several consequences.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Firstly, the normalisation of mass surveillance systems and the state-enforced silences in the name of &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; are catastrophic to the imaginaries of individual civil liberties. The human rights issue is the primary problem, evidently seen in the covert and coercive monitoring mechanisms in the Xinjiang and Tibet Autonomous Regions. Severe incursions on reproductive rights of ethnic minorities (such as the campaigns against &lsquo;illegal births&rsquo;), their right to language and religion, and more importantly, their right to live together as a household are all devastatingly controlled by tech-intensive methods of digital enclosures. Given that China spends substantially more on internal security in its defence budget, further investments and deployment of intrusive technologies for effective surveillance and ethnic sorting are gravely concerning. Furthermore, the differences in how each state employs surveillance technologies and associated human rights issues will further widen the ideological gap between the western liberal international order and the nationalistic ambitions of the Chinese communist party.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Secondly, with the state embracing AI technologies with increasing speed and scale, the imminent indigenous innovation and technological self-sufficiency make the exercise of an aggressive foreign policy more expedient. In general, the ambitions of fragile and autocratic regimes to deploy mass surveillance are often hindered by the low level of domestic technological capabilities, thereby urging these regimes to get into international collaborations30. China&rsquo;s Belt Road Initiative (and a Digital Silk Road) becomes crucial here. With the entry of state-backed Chinese companies into the European and African markets, the export of security technologies is imminent31. As of 2018, thirty-six BRI countries have incorporated significant AI surveillance technologies for their domestic governance. In export technologies &ndash; mainly for smart city platforms, facial recognition systems, and smart policing - China is now the leading supplier of AI surveillance technology, according to the AI Global Surveillance Index32. The increasing export of these technologies can also lead to the adoption of CPC&rsquo;s practices for social and political control across states33. For instance, avowing effective public diplomacy, China trains Latin American and African journalists to utilise emerging technologies for their professions. These exports and training programmes influence include a vast number of actors that tend to form a &lsquo;security-industrial complex&rsquo; where private companies along with the MPS are progressively becoming responsible for the export of surveillance goods34.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In sum, we see that China&rsquo;s grand strategy of &lsquo;social stability and enduring peace&rsquo; is sought through an authoritarian flavour of digital entrenchment. China&rsquo;s informatisation and surveillance backbone is the big data-driven large-scale deployment of machine learning algorithms, AI, facial recognition technologies, and other sophisticated technologies backed by an intelligent infrastructure35. As discussed, AI technologies may appear to remedy regime&rsquo;s insecurity and as an efficient tool for social governance. This being said, nation-states should be cautious with their technological collaborations with China. The diffusion of AI-based surveillance power into society will not only distort democratic ideals but will also escalate geopolitical risks at an unprecedented and uncontrollable scale.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sruthi Kalyani is a research scholar at the Centre of East Asian Studies (Chinese Studies Division), School of International Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.

This trend has further intensified since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with states such as China having justified invasive and sophisticated forms of AI-powered surveillance for the sake of public health management. As Katherine Mason 1 has observed, China\'s epidemic management mechanism exhibits a \'permanent and intractable bifurcation of service and governance\' that not only leads to various ethical challenges but also closes the opportunities for the outside world to scrutinise the dire realities happening within the boundaries of the party-state.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hence, what we see is a state that comes with the intention of \'social governance\' but then transmutes itself into a surveillance state where the promises of governance are framed within coercive procedures of social control. The \'prevention and control\' (fangkong) doctrine that has been officially followed for handling previous public health crises in China since the SARS epidemic of 20032, remains instrumental for tackling the ongoing \'people&rsquo;s war&rsquo; against COVID-193. &nbsp; The &lsquo;prevention and control&rsquo; system thus in place is also increasingly being utilised for resolving political risks, tightening public security, and maintaining social stability4.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Amidst more informatised and intelligent forms of surveillance and control, especially when these technologies are widely exported, the geopolitical implications are worrisome.

In export technologies &ndash; mainly for smart city platforms, facial recognition systems, and smart policing - China is now the leading supplier of AI surveillance technology, according to the AI Global Surveillance Index32. The increasing export of these technologies can also lead to the adoption of CPC&rsquo;s practices for social and political control across states33. For instance, avowing effective public diplomacy, China trains Latin American and African journalists to utilise emerging technologies for their professions.

This trend has further intensified since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with states such as China having justified invasive and sophisticated forms of AI-powered surveillance for the sake of public health management. As Katherine Mason 1 has observed, China\'s epidemic management mechanism exhibits a \'permanent and intractable bifurcation of service and governance\' that not only leads to various ethical challenges but also closes the opportunities for the outside world to scrutinise the dire realities happening within the boundaries of the party-state.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hence, what we see is a state that comes with the intention of \'social governance\' but then transmutes itself into a surveillance state where the promises of governance are framed within coercive procedures of social control. The \'prevention and control\' (fangkong) doctrine that has been officially followed for handling previous public health crises in China since the SARS epidemic of 20032, remains instrumental for tackling the ongoing \'people&rsquo;s war&rsquo; against COVID-193. &nbsp; The &lsquo;prevention and control&rsquo; system thus in place is also increasingly being utilised for resolving political risks, tightening public security, and maintaining social stability4.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Amidst more informatised and intelligent forms of surveillance and control, especially when these technologies are widely exported, the geopolitical implications are worrisome. With these concerns, this issue brief attempts to study and analyse the consequences of China&rsquo;s &lsquo;intelligentised social governance&rsquo;. The brief is divided into two sections - the first section outlines the development of China&rsquo;s surveillance mechanisms over the years, and the second section identifies certain geopolitical implications of China&rsquo;s digital authoritarianism and surveillance practices.</p>\r\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">The Rise of the Surveillance State</h1>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While various social management and surveillance mechanisms have been carried out in China for many years, the term &lsquo;intelligentisation of social governance&rsquo; finds its genesis in the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan (AIDP). In July 2017, for building China&rsquo;s first-mover advantage in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the State Council announced the AIDP 5 . Alongside various targets, it envisaged the construction&nbsp; of a &lsquo;safe and convenient</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1 Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, Vintage, 1979</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">intelligent society&rsquo; and modernised &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; (shehui zhili) via the use of AI-enabled high-quality services in areas of governance such as administrative management, judicial management, urban management, and so on6. The document observes the need for an intelligent infrastructure powered by collaborative AI, big data and high-performance computing to significantly elevate capabilities to effectively &lsquo;construct governance&rsquo; for maintaining societal stability. Whilst party control over the public and public information for constructing governance has been practised for a long time throughout the communist party regime, particular leadership changes have effectuated certain distinct forms of surveillance and control in practice. Despite the promise of governance aimed at guidance rather than control by providing more responsibilities to the civil societies and market forces7, Hoffman and Mattis8 note that &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; that is being practised in the Xi Jinping era under the aegis of the State Security Committee has more centralising tendencies than the &lsquo;social management&rsquo; (shehui guanli) that was followed in the Hu Jintao era. The shift towards social governance to &lsquo;strengthen leadership by the Party committee&rsquo; and a &lsquo;leading role of the government9&rsquo; is significant to observe for the rise of the surveillance state, especially when it is increasingly equipping itself with high-tech tools to govern. Understanding the evolution of surveillance policy is essential to gauge the increasing presence of the Chinese surveillance state in people&rsquo;s socio-political lives today.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 1996, the State Council issued Order No. 95 for the &ldquo;Management of Computer Information Networks hooked up with International Networks&rdquo; that paved the initial path towards establishing the state&rsquo;s managerial power over its internet users through &ldquo;unified planning, unified standards, and separation of management at different levels&rdquo; 10. In 2000, after the Golden Shield Project (jindun gongcheng) was envisaged, China&rsquo;s internet, protected by the Great Firewall, was practically made into an intranet within its territory. The state tracked and censored controversial political opinions and online dissidents through this. It strengthened the state&rsquo;s internet censorship and allowed private players to provide data-driven solutions for the surveillance project.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thus, the Golden Shield Project was seen as a significant change from a generalised control of online content towards individualised user surveillance and automated information sharing11. It brought forth integrated information platforms (zonghe xinxi pingtai) and a four-tiered security network (gongan wang) that connected the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) with its local governance bureaus, thereby creating a unified command over police work12. It was only in 2013, after the establishment of the Cyberspace Administration Commission, the complete and centralised control of the state&rsquo;s internet entirely materialised. The Great Firewall now uses robust AI monitoring and filtering mechanisms to control social movements and people&rsquo;s mobilisation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another tool of the state&rsquo;s social management is the grassroots-level monitoring of the grid management system (wanggehua guanli) that became operational in some cities as early as 2004. Through a &lsquo;system of contracted responsibility&rsquo; (chengbao zeren zhi), cities were divided into basic &lsquo;management units of digital city&rsquo;, and information of residents and migrant workers was</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">collected for policing at the established grid levels13. With the goal of stability maintenance, the grid management system employs invasive approaches to gather citizen information. With more technologies assisting the data gathering and grid monitoring processes, the party-state has established encompassing top-down management of public security14. Besides grid management, to encourage innovation in the &lsquo;dynamic management of social conflicts&rsquo; and public opinion influence, the State Council issued guiding opinions on social management innovation&rsquo; in 2011. Through these opinions, the party fostered and invested in intermediary civil society organisations that promised to engage in the vision of stability maintenance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Intending to make China a &ldquo;strong internet power&rdquo;, the 12th Five Year Plan as well as the &ldquo;Internet Plus&rdquo; strategy of 2011, have led to increasing investments in the emerging fields of big data and Internet of Things (IoT). Consequently, such investments have enabled the state to create big data algorithms for the project of social surveillance, yet again. One such major development is the Social Credit System (shehui xinyong) which was first proposed in 201415. Based on big-data algorithms, this system evaluates a Chinese citizen\'s &ldquo;social trustworthiness&rdquo;. It is expected to cover all of the 1.4 billion Chinese citizens by 2022. The social credit system comes not only as a tool to evaluate the financial trustworthiness of the citizens but it also enables the technology- driven implementation of &ldquo;responsibility mechanisms&rdquo; and a simultaneous social control<sup>16</sup>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The involvement of private companies in the implementation of this project has further strengthened the technological infrastructures on which state surveillance is carried out 17 . Guidelines and warnings regarding the &ldquo;trustworthiness&rdquo; of citizens have been released since the rollout of the social credit system. Various documents and regulations released by the CPC (Communist Party of China)&rsquo;s Central Committee such as the &lsquo;Rongcheng Municipal Measures on Personal Credit Rewards and Punishments&rsquo;2, provincial regulations such as the &lsquo;Guangdong Provincial Social Credit Regulations&rsquo;3, and warning documents such as &lsquo;Warning and Punishment Mechanisms for Trust-Breakers&rsquo;, and more, imply the state&rsquo;s intentions of not only monitoring but also modifying the behavioural preferences and the conduct of its citizens. With AI-driven technologies and innovative prevention and control systems, the mechanisms of social governance are ubiquitously engrained into the daily lives of Chinese citizens. Hence, this is a notable shift from the yesteryears of &lsquo;management&rsquo; and maintenance of social stability.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Chinese tech-enabled surveillance reached its heights upon the implementation of the &lsquo;Sharp Eyes&rsquo; (xueliang) project in 2015. This project aimed at achieving complete coverage and &ldquo;full control&rdquo; of all of China&rsquo;s public areas by 202018. As a measure, the Ministry of Public Security called for a &ldquo;fully networked and fully controllable&rdquo; national video surveillance network.

This trend has further intensified since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with states such as China having justified invasive and sophisticated forms of AI-powered surveillance for the sake of public health management. As Katherine Mason 1 has observed, China\'s epidemic management mechanism exhibits a \'permanent and intractable bifurcation of service and governance\' that not only leads to various ethical challenges but also closes the opportunities for the outside world to scrutinise the dire realities happening within the boundaries of the party-state.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hence, what we see is a state that comes with the intention of \'social governance\' but then transmutes itself into a surveillance state where the promises of governance are framed within coercive procedures of social control. The \'prevention and control\' (fangkong) doctrine that has been officially followed for handling previous public health crises in China since the SARS epidemic of 20032, remains instrumental for tackling the ongoing \'people&rsquo;s war&rsquo; against COVID-193. &nbsp; The &lsquo;prevention and control&rsquo; system thus in place is also increasingly being utilised for resolving political risks, tightening public security, and maintaining social stability4.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Amidst more informatised and intelligent forms of surveillance and control, especially when these technologies are widely exported, the geopolitical implications are worrisome. With these concerns, this issue brief attempts to study and analyse the consequences of China&rsquo;s &lsquo;intelligentised social governance&rsquo;. The brief is divided into two sections - the first section outlines the development of China&rsquo;s surveillance mechanisms over the years, and the second section identifies certain geopolitical implications of China&rsquo;s digital authoritarianism and surveillance practices.</p>\r\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">The Rise of the Surveillance State</h1>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While various social management and surveillance mechanisms have been carried out in China for many years, the term &lsquo;intelligentisation of social governance&rsquo; finds its genesis in the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan (AIDP). In July 2017, for building China&rsquo;s first-mover advantage in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the State Council announced the AIDP 5 . Alongside various targets, it envisaged the construction&nbsp; of a &lsquo;safe and convenient</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1 Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, Vintage, 1979</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">intelligent society&rsquo; and modernised &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; (shehui zhili) via the use of AI-enabled high-quality services in areas of governance such as administrative management, judicial management, urban management, and so on6. The document observes the need for an intelligent infrastructure powered by collaborative AI, big data and high-performance computing to significantly elevate capabilities to effectively &lsquo;construct governance&rsquo; for maintaining societal stability. Whilst party control over the public and public information for constructing governance has been practised for a long time throughout the communist party regime, particular leadership changes have effectuated certain distinct forms of surveillance and control in practice. Despite the promise of governance aimed at guidance rather than control by providing more responsibilities to the civil societies and market forces7, Hoffman and Mattis8 note that &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; that is being practised in the Xi Jinping era under the aegis of the State Security Committee has more centralising tendencies than the &lsquo;social management&rsquo; (shehui guanli) that was followed in the Hu Jintao era. The shift towards social governance to &lsquo;strengthen leadership by the Party committee&rsquo; and a &lsquo;leading role of the government9&rsquo; is significant to observe for the rise of the surveillance state, especially when it is increasingly equipping itself with high-tech tools to govern. Understanding the evolution of surveillance policy is essential to gauge the increasing presence of the Chinese surveillance state in people&rsquo;s socio-political lives today.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 1996, the State Council issued Order No. 95 for the &ldquo;Management of Computer Information Networks hooked up with International Networks&rdquo; that paved the initial path towards establishing the state&rsquo;s managerial power over its internet users through &ldquo;unified planning, unified standards, and separation of management at different levels&rdquo; 10. In 2000, after the Golden Shield Project (jindun gongcheng) was envisaged, China&rsquo;s internet, protected by the Great Firewall, was practically made into an intranet within its territory. The state tracked and censored controversial political opinions and online dissidents through this. It strengthened the state&rsquo;s internet censorship and allowed private players to provide data-driven solutions for the surveillance project.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thus, the Golden Shield Project was seen as a significant change from a generalised control of online content towards individualised user surveillance and automated information sharing11. It brought forth integrated information platforms (zonghe xinxi pingtai) and a four-tiered security network (gongan wang) that connected the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) with its local governance bureaus, thereby creating a unified command over police work12. It was only in 2013, after the establishment of the Cyberspace Administration Commission, the complete and centralised control of the state&rsquo;s internet entirely materialised. The Great Firewall now uses robust AI monitoring and filtering mechanisms to control social movements and people&rsquo;s mobilisation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another tool of the state&rsquo;s social management is the grassroots-level monitoring of the grid management system (wanggehua guanli) that became operational in some cities as early as 2004. Through a &lsquo;system of contracted responsibility&rsquo; (chengbao zeren zhi), cities were divided into basic &lsquo;management units of digital city&rsquo;, and information of residents and migrant workers was</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">collected for policing at the established grid levels13. With the goal of stability maintenance, the grid management system employs invasive approaches to gather citizen information. With more technologies assisting the data gathering and grid monitoring processes, the party-state has established encompassing top-down management of public security14. Besides grid management, to encourage innovation in the &lsquo;dynamic management of social conflicts&rsquo; and public opinion influence, the State Council issued guiding opinions on social management innovation&rsquo; in 2011. Through these opinions, the party fostered and invested in intermediary civil society organisations that promised to engage in the vision of stability maintenance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Intending to make China a &ldquo;strong internet power&rdquo;, the 12th Five Year Plan as well as the &ldquo;Internet Plus&rdquo; strategy of 2011, have led to increasing investments in the emerging fields of big data and Internet of Things (IoT). Consequently, such investments have enabled the state to create big data algorithms for the project of social surveillance, yet again. One such major development is the Social Credit System (shehui xinyong) which was first proposed in 201415. Based on big-data algorithms, this system evaluates a Chinese citizen\'s &ldquo;social trustworthiness&rdquo;. It is expected to cover all of the 1.4 billion Chinese citizens by 2022. The social credit system comes not only as a tool to evaluate the financial trustworthiness of the citizens but it also enables the technology- driven implementation of &ldquo;responsibility mechanisms&rdquo; and a simultaneous social control<sup>16</sup>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The involvement of private companies in the implementation of this project has further strengthened the technological infrastructures on which state surveillance is carried out 17 . Guidelines and warnings regarding the &ldquo;trustworthiness&rdquo; of citizens have been released since the rollout of the social credit system. Various documents and regulations released by the CPC (Communist Party of China)&rsquo;s Central Committee such as the &lsquo;Rongcheng Municipal Measures on Personal Credit Rewards and Punishments&rsquo;2, provincial regulations such as the &lsquo;Guangdong Provincial Social Credit Regulations&rsquo;3, and warning documents such as &lsquo;Warning and Punishment Mechanisms for Trust-Breakers&rsquo;, and more, imply the state&rsquo;s intentions of not only monitoring but also modifying the behavioural preferences and the conduct of its citizens. With AI-driven technologies and innovative prevention and control systems, the mechanisms of social governance are ubiquitously engrained into the daily lives of Chinese citizens. Hence, this is a notable shift from the yesteryears of &lsquo;management&rsquo; and maintenance of social stability.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Chinese tech-enabled surveillance reached its heights upon the implementation of the &lsquo;Sharp Eyes&rsquo; (xueliang) project in 2015. This project aimed at achieving complete coverage and &ldquo;full control&rdquo; of all of China&rsquo;s public areas by 202018. As a measure, the Ministry of Public Security called for a &ldquo;fully networked and fully controllable&rdquo; national video surveillance network. The ministry also instructed the nationwide &lsquo;Police Cloud&rsquo; project envisaging integrated gathering of</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2 For Translation, see - <a href=\"https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-punishment-measures/\">https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-</a> <a href=\"https://www.chinalwtranslate.com/en/rongcheng-personal-credit-reward-and-punishment-measures/\">punishment-measures/</a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3 For Translation, see - <a href=\"https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/guandong-provincial-social-credit/\">https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/guandong-provincial-social-credit/</a></p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">four types of data: public security professional data, government department management data, public service agency business data, and Internet data 19.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The data thus gathered from citizens are as sensitively personal as their medical records, transaction histories with e-commerce companies, travel histories, etc.20. It is estimated that by the end of 2021, the total number of surveillance cameras will grow beyond 400 million &ndash; amounting to approximately one camera for every three citizens21. This shows that the extent of surveillance is on the rise in China. Furthermore, to enable joint work of such projects and to legitimise the proliferation of private technologies for the state&rsquo;s use, the National Intelligence Law of 2017 purported to &ldquo;unify and centralise&rdquo; intelligence systems 22 . Through this legislation, private companies are mandated for assisting and cooperating with the state&rsquo;s intelligence network. In 2018, The white paper on AI Security released by the Chinese Academy for Information Technology recommended public opinion monitoring and &lsquo;automating&rsquo; social governance, acknowledging the substantial role of private companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu in the implementation of the intelligentisation of social governance23.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Above all, some provinces\' surveillance intentions and procedures are more alarming than others, Xinjiang being the palpable reality. While predictive policing systems across the globe unduly harm ethnic minorities, and that racial bias is becoming disturbingly common, the practice of bio- metric surveillance in Xinjiang is a peculiar case. It comes with the blatantly pretentious promise of &ldquo;scientific decision-making&rdquo; towards public healthcare, poverty alleviation, and indeed, the maintenance of social stability. The &lsquo;Physicals for All&rsquo; programme that was launched in 2017 for the sake of &ldquo;national health examination work&rdquo; in Xinjiang24, forcibly collected blood samples and biometric details of the region&rsquo;s residents to create a DNA databank25. Being the first state to employ AI for racial profiling26, China&rsquo;s policies towards the Uyghur Muslims are undoubtedly driven by &lsquo;algorithms of repression&rsquo;. Mass surveillance in Xinjiang is conducted through the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP) that deploys &ldquo;wifi sniffers&rdquo;, machine sensors, and other sophisticated facial recognition technologies to monitor, store, and manage residents&rsquo; activities27. All the extracted data is localised within the domestic territory. For the Chinese state, the IJOP is a technological solution devised to &ldquo;inquire, investigate and thoroughly sort&rdquo; the ideological and familial issues of the population28. To target the Muslim minorities, mosques are labelled as &ldquo;high-risk&rdquo; areas and are monitored through real-time video. For striking hard against terrorism and Islamic extremism, the state utilises high-tech surveillance to vigil day-to-day activities, and profiles certain religious and cultural practices as &ldquo;pre-crimes&rdquo;. Ironically, at a time when such systems are systematically well-deployed and functioning, China has signed the United Nations&rsquo; pledge on banning AI for social scoring systems4.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">4 For further details, read UNESCO&rsquo;s draft text of the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Intelligence - https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379920.page=14</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">Concerns and Implications</h1>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite the sanguine possibilities portrayed by the party-state in the name of &lsquo;surveilling and serving&rsquo;, it is foreseeable that AI technologies will make authoritarianism more sustainable, at the least in the medium term29. Domestically, we see that public opinion is controlled and manipulated through automated internet censorship. Additionally, AI-powered technological ownership will enable Chairman Xi Jinping to assert more power and control over the party elites. In the international context, there are several consequences.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Firstly, the normalisation of mass surveillance systems and the state-enforced silences in the name of &lsquo;social governance&rsquo; are catastrophic to the imaginaries of individual civil liberties. The human rights issue is the primary problem, evidently seen in the covert and coercive monitoring mechanisms in the Xinjiang and Tibet Autonomous Regions. Severe incursions on reproductive rights of ethnic minorities (such as the campaigns against &lsquo;illegal births&rsquo;), their right to language and religion, and more importantly, their right to live together as a household are all devastatingly controlled by tech-intensive methods of digital enclosures. Given that China spends substantially more on internal security in its defence budget, further investments and deployment of intrusive technologies for effective surveillance and ethnic sorting are gravely concerning. Furthermore, the differences in how each state employs surveillance technologies and associated human rights issues will further widen the ideological gap between the western liberal international order and the nationalistic ambitions of the Chinese communist party.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Secondly, with the state embracing AI technologies with increasing speed and scale, the imminent indigenous innovation and technological self-sufficiency make the exercise of an aggressive foreign policy more expedient. In general, the ambitions of fragile and autocratic regimes to deploy mass surveillance are often hindered by the low level of domestic technological capabilities, thereby urging these regimes to get into international collaborations30. China&rsquo;s Belt Road Initiative (and a Digital Silk Road) becomes crucial here. With the entry of state-backed Chinese companies into the European and African markets, the export of security technologies is imminent31. As of 2018, thirty-six BRI countries have incorporated significant AI surveillance technologies for their domestic governance. In export technologies &ndash; mainly for smart city platforms, facial recognition systems, and smart policing - China is now the leading supplier of AI surveillance technology, according to the AI Global Surveillance Index32. The increasing export of these technologies can also lead to the adoption of CPC&rsquo;s practices for social and political control across states33. For instance, avowing effective public diplomacy, China trains Latin American and African journalists to utilise emerging technologies for their professions. These exports and training programmes influence include a vast number of actors that tend to form a &lsquo;security-industrial complex&rsquo; where private companies along with the MPS are progressively becoming responsible for the export of surveillance goods34.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><br><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In sum, we see that China&rsquo;s grand strategy of &lsquo;social stability and enduring peace&rsquo; is sought through an authoritarian flavour of digital entrenchment. China&rsquo;s informatisation and surveillance backbone is the big data-driven large-scale deployment of machine learning algorithms, AI, facial recognition technologies, and other sophisticated technologies backed by an intelligent infrastructure35. As discussed, AI technologies may appear to remedy regime&rsquo;s insecurity and as an efficient tool for social governance. This being said, nation-states should be cautious with their technological collaborations with China. The diffusion of AI-based surveillance power into society will not only distort democratic ideals but will also escalate geopolitical risks at an unprecedented and uncontrollable scale.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sruthi Kalyani is a research scholar at the Centre of East Asian Studies (Chinese Studies Division), School of International Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.

This list included more state-run media outlets which highlights further that the information that is circulated in the country will be monitored by the State. The reason given by the Chinese officials for this updated list was that media outlets were no longer meeting the requirements and have poor daily influence.

China blocks many foreign websites, including Facebook, Instagram, and some Google services; still, the Chinese public has found ways to circumvent the so-called Great Firewall. The four major national networks, namely CSTNET, ChinaNet, CERNET and CHINAGBN, are the \"backbone\" of the mainland Chinese internet and ultimately seek to further the CCP\'s maintenance of the \'Great Firewall\'. They are state-funded, and therein owe allegiance to the Party.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Recently the Chinese government has also released its updated Market Access Negative List (MANL) which prohibited private investment in media outlets. As reported in ORCA\'s October 15, 2021 <a href=\"https://orcasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15.10.21-1.pdf\">CiCM newsletter</a>, pro-CCP netizens showed support for curb on private media companies via the Market Access Negative List. While the CCP maintains strict control over limiting any potential criticism of its practices, Weibo still emerges as a platform where citizens voice concerns over certain policies (in quickly censored posts). For instance, recent CiCM reports have covered instances of women voicing criticism of the <a href=\"https://orcasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/25.11.21-1.pdf\">one-child policy</a> and discussions over disco-</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">-<a href=\"https://orcasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/23.11.21.pdf\">ntent </a>vis-a-vis the marriage leave system.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite such brief examples, such List(s) by the Chinese government raise serious threats to the quality of journalistic practices in the country and how that will shape up in the coming future.
