Wade judgement was overturned. Yet it remains and will arguably be one of the most contentious decisions pertaining to human rights. Several stories have come to light as a part of this conversation.</p>\r\n<p id=\"be52\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ip iq ir is b it jn gr iv iw jo gv iy iz jp jb jc jd jq jf jg jh jr jj jk jl jm bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Dr. Savita Halappanavar was a 31-year-old bright and accomplished woman, who lived in Galway, Ireland, and worked as a dentist. However, her death sentence had already been codified into law in 1983 in the form of the 8th Amendment that banned abortion in the Catholic country of Ireland- a punitive measure against innocent women. She passed away in 2012 after contracting an infection, septicemia, after being denied an abortion on the grounds of the fetus &lsquo;still having a heartbeat&rsquo;, even when it was an inexorable fact that it would not survive. She became a martyr for the abortion movement in Ireland. Her face and her story were what people rallied and marched around to finally ensure the protection of a woman&rsquo;s right to abortion in Ireland, which came to effect on January 1st, 2019. A mere three years after the strenuous triumph in Ireland, a pernicious reversal of fifty years worth of progress in human rights in the United States of America came in the form of the overturning of Roe V Wade. The U.S. has always been the default cornerstone to look up to by the rest of the world when it comes to human rights and democracy, as proudly advertised by the country itself numerous times throughout history. However, this development has revealed how diaphanous the apparent safety and security of women is in any part of the world. The reversal has been predicted to deeply affect marginalized communities. Through this blog piece, we focus on how this issue is pertinent to Indians, Indian Americans, and International Students.</p>\r\n<p id=\"d508\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ip iq ir is b it jn gr iv iw jo gv iy iz jp jb jc jd jq jf jg jh jr jj jk jl jm bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Adhering to the deeply ingrained partisan nature of politics in the country, U.S. states demonstrated a striking split in the way they would utilize the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision of leaving abortion rights up to each state. 13 states (Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming) already had trigger bans in place that would go into effect immediately in case Roe v Wade was overturned. Conversely, 16 states (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington) alongside DC had laws in place that would protect abortion rights. Including the 13 trigger ban states, a total of 26 U.S. states are likely to act on the overturning and severely restrict abortion rights. The impact of the trigger ban was felt jarringly in an abortion clinic in Houston, Texas- a state with a highly concentrated Indian American population (443.3K). Even though the ban would not go to effect until 30 days, the clinic canceled the 10 appointments scheduled for the day in trepidation of being prosecuted by the state, which also had other laws against abortion (laws of the 1960s) predating Roe v Wade that were never repealed. There was disbelief, shock, tears, and most hauntingly- numbness in the faces of the women who had come in for a second chance at life. Their lives were completely debilitated with the quickness and relentlessness of lightning. For states with such laws in place, the next option is to travel over state borders to be able to access an abortion. In states like Texas, which is engirdled by states with little to no abortion access, distant travel needs to be undertaken for the procedure. Even if travel is scheduled somehow, the states that protect abortion rights would have an influx of people seeking an abortion, making it nearly impossible to get access on time. This situation is more terrifying for international students.</p>\r\n<p id=\"4704\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ip iq ir is b it jn gr iv iw jo gv iy iz jp jb jc jd jq jf jg jh jr jj jk jl jm bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">As of 2021, the number of Indian students studying in the United States increased by 12% (25,391 additional students compared to the previous year). Out of these, 37% of the students were female. Out of the 10 states mostly favored by international students, 4 protect abortion rights, while 6 severely restrict them. The overturning of Roe V Wade is a petrifying situation for international students stuck in a state that has stripped away women of this life-saving right. In addition to the various apprehensions and encumbrances that arise with trying to adjust to an environment stranger to anything they have ever known, students now have another baleful threat to overcome.</p>\r\n<p id=\"a6dd\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ip iq ir is b it jn gr iv iw jo gv iy iz jp jb jc jd jq jf jg jh jr jj jk jl jm bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Living thousands of miles away from home, they are paralyzed and stranded and travel is seldom easily accessible- not to mention, costly. Furthermore, there is a myriad of other nuances related to culture, gender, and society that one battles with, for even when removed from the surroundings, these beliefs stay strongly rooted in them and their fellow Indian peer group. While the boundaries set by one&rsquo;s own culture lighten but persist, the ubiquitousness of misogyny and rape-culture still envelopes the university experience- a fact that is echoed in the often untold stories of many young women. Such is the story of our anonymous guest writer in the following paragraph, where she recounts her experiences and explains what the overturning of Roe V Wade means for her as an international Indian student:</p>\r\n<p id=\"9215\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ip iq ir is b it jn gr iv iw jo gv iy iz jp jb jc jd jq jf jg jh jr jj jk jl jm bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">&ldquo; I come from a very conservative and controlling family, and when I secured a place in my dream university abroad, I was beyond elated. The thought of having limitless freedom had me daydreaming. My university experience kicked off with these same expectations. I befriended some fellow international Indian students, and together we all explored this new world we had been plunged into. However, this concept of limitless freedom translated into a much horrible meaning for a boy I called one of my closest friends there. One night, he came to my room and what was supposed to be a normal conversation like usual turned into the stuff of every girl&rsquo;s nightmare &mdash; he raped me. I was devastated. When I tried to speak up, I was immediately threatened by him, and slut-shamed and victim-blamed by the girls in the group. But my worst fear was getting pregnant with his child. The potential pregnancy would be my death sentence. Furthermore, this would have been solid evidence of him assaulting me, and this fact pushed him and a group of men he knew into threatening me. He was a psychopath, and I was scared of what he and his friends might do to me. On the other hand, breaking this news to my family, who are extremely conservative, would have led to me being confined to my house and being emotionally and physically abused till the end of my days. Not just that, I could never imagine living with a child, who was born out of this atrocity. Even the thought of having no access to abortion at that stage scares me to death right now. I feel for all women who will be affected by this horrible loss.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p id=\"ec84\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ip iq ir is b it jn gr iv iw jo gv iy iz jp jb jc jd jq jf jg jh jr jj jk jl jm bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">This is the story of many young women, who are often forced to abandon their goals and dreams due to circumstances designed to keep women in the cycle of servitude. Though such extreme and painful circumstances should not be the only reason to warrant abortion rights, it has been found on numerous occasions that even these reasons fail in providing women with empathy and access to basic healthcare. Women and what they do with their bodies are not grounds for debate or scrutiny- still, certain conservative beliefs prevailing in Indian societies curtail women through slut-shaming, victim-blaming, moral-policing, and guilt-tripping. Even though the abortion laws in India are much more liberal than the current reality of the United States, the legal safeguards are negated by what goes on in the streets. Unsafe abortions are the third leading cause of maternal deaths in India (resulting in 8 new deaths every day), with many women still living in fear of acknowledging premarital sexual activity, needing consent from their husbands for abortion even though the law does not require it, and resorting to unsafe abortion methods leading to infections and even death (67% of the total abortion procedures conducted are considered unsafe). Such is the state of a country where abortions are protected by the law- what happens when the law takes those rights away? This development puts the lives of thousands of women at risk.</p>\r\n<p id=\"53ad\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ip iq ir is b it jn gr iv iw jo gv iy iz jp jb jc jd jq jf jg jh jr jj jk jl jm bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"is mh\">Resources:</strong></p>\r\n<p id=\"c0f8\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ip iq ir is b it jn gr iv iw jo gv iy iz jp jb jc jd jq jf jg jh jr jj jk jl jm bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">So, what are the resources one can look towards? Even though President Joe Biden signed an executive order exercising his power to try and safeguard the right to abortion, many pro-choice activists believe that it would have little to no effect. In such a case, it is up to those seeking an abortion to practice discernment and keep knowledge of the options they have. A group of journalists, activists, and artists on the Instagram account @themeteor keep updates on any developments regarding abortion rights in different states and also provide lists of resources on their account.

An organization called Just the Pill would be launching a fleet of mobile clinics and stationing them alongside state borders, providing consultations for medication abortions, dispensing pills, and providing surgical abortions. The vans &lsquo;take approximately 8 months to build and are nondescript, devoid of signage, and bulletproof.&rsquo; For those seeking the procedure in the deep south, deploying floating abortion clinics in the Gulf of Mexico to bypass stringent restrictions has been proposed by Dr. Meg Autry, an obstetrician, gynecologist, and professor at UC San Francisco. Organizations such as the Brigid Alliance &lsquo;book, coordinate and pay for travel, travel expenses, and child care, serving as a single, trusted point of contact for every step of the journey.&rsquo; Additionally, many prominent companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Conde Nast, Netflix, Disney, Sony, Warner bros Discovery, and so on are retaining or expanding their healthcare benefits for employees to cover the expense of interstate travel to facilitate abortion. However, the scope of interstate travel is an issue that is developing in real-time, with states like Texas and Oklahoma trying to ensure punitive measures for those &lsquo;aiding and abetting&rsquo; abortion through travel.</p>\r\n<p id=\"efea\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ip iq ir is b it jn gr iv iw jo gv iy iz jp jb jc jd jq jf jg jh jr jj jk jl jm bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"is mh\">University Action:</strong></p>\r\n<p id=\"1fd9\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ip iq ir is b it jn gr iv iw jo gv iy iz jp jb jc jd jq jf jg jh jr jj jk jl jm bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Universities like the University of Michigan, where abortion remains legal, anticipated the overturning of Roe V Wade as soon as the draft was leaked by the Supreme Court. President of the University, Mary Sue Coleman, and Michigan Medicine CEO Marschall S. Runge established a &lsquo;university-wide task force on abortion care access.&rsquo; University of California President Michael V. Drake, highlighting his stance against the overturning of Roe V Wade, made the following statement: &ldquo;We strongly support allowing individuals to access evidence-based health care services and to make decisions about their own care in consultation with their medical team. Despite this decision by the Court, we will continue to provide the full range of health care options possible in California, including reproductive health services, and to steadfastly advocate for the needs of our patients, students, staff, and the communities we serve.&rdquo; However, for the most part, colleges are severely underprepared for the situation, according to an article by Bianca Quilantan for the Politico. The restrictions on abortion access would either leave college students to raise children on college campuses or drop their education. Colleges aren&rsquo;t prepared to adequately support students who are parenting and getting their education at the same time.</p>\r\n<p id=\"8459\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ip iq ir is b it jn gr iv iw jo gv iy iz jp jb jc jd jq jf jg jh jr jj jk jl jm bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Comments by Indian American Lawmakers</p>\r\n<p id=\"c6a6\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ip iq ir is b it jn gr iv iw jo gv iy iz jp jb jc jd jq jf jg jh jr jj jk jl jm bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Many Indian-American lawmakers condemned the Supreme Court ruling, releasing numerous statements concerning the issue. Jay Chaudhari, a North Carolina state senator criticized the decision, calling it a huge setback to the progress in women&rsquo;s rights in the past decades, while simultaneously urging citizens to prepare for the imperative upcoming elections in a way that ensures attacking this problem. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democratic Congressman from Illinois unequivocally sided with women&rsquo;s right to choose in his statement. U.S Vice President Kamala Harris stated in her address at Plainfield Illinois, &ldquo;This is the first time in the history of our nation that a constitutional right has been taken from the people of America. And what is that right? &mdash; some might ask. It&rsquo;s the right to privacy. Think about it as the right for each person to make intimate decisions about heart and home; decisions about the right to start a family, including contraception, such as IUDs and the morning-after pill; decisions about whether to have a child, including, as Senator Durbin mentioned, through in-vitro fertilization; decisions to marry the person you love &mdash; Obergefell v. Hodges, Loving vs. Virginia.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p id=\"7c4b\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ip iq ir is b it jn gr iv iw jo gv iy iz jp jb jc jd jq jf jg jh jr jj jk jl jm bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The overturning of Roe V Wade instigates a conversation about notions that transcend present time- failures and successes of society that would always be relevant, problems that would arise repeatedly because the root cause persisted. The actions of lawmakers aren&rsquo;t mere statements written in a book- they affect real people in extremely tangible ways- making or marring lives. Such changes alter the lives of all, but their influence is felt differently across communities- owing to nuances of culture, gender, religion, class, and race. In times like these, it is essential to have conversations within communities and exercise the power of choosing representatives who would truly work for our benefit.</p>\r\n<p id=\"6470\"

She showed me queer life was possible&hellip;and beautiful&rdquo;, wrote Alok Vaid-Menon, prominent LGBTQ activist and poet, in his tribute to his late aunt. It goes to show that the legacies people leave behind aren&rsquo;t just confined to mere words on a sheet of paper that neatly list accomplishments. The trace of their true impact cannot be quantified- because large-scale activism is an immeasurable pursuit that not only constitutes tangible change but the impalpable transformation of the hearts and minds of millions. The impact of Urvashi Vaid&rsquo;s activism was not comparable to the flap of a delicate wing in the butterfly effect, but to striking lightning that brings thundering intensity afterward. That is how one can describe the place of a pioneer in this world- and that&rsquo;s who she was.</p>\r\n<p id=\"502b\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ie if gw ig b ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb gp bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Even as a young Indian immigrant to the US who migrated to New York with her family at the age of 8 in 1966, her rebelliousness could not be caged. The spirit of change was bubbling in the air in the late 1900s, scattering seeds of reform that would plant themselves firmly to the ground and brave the storms that were set against them from the very start. Vaid was one of those seeds, and she attributes her nature to the various movements going on around her at that time- Civil Rights, Women&rsquo;s Liberation, Student Activism, and so on- she protested the Vietnam War as young as the age of 11.</p>\r\n<p id=\"9c2c\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ie if gw ig b ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb gp bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">During a time when basic human empathy was considered contrarian, it was pioneers like her who represented defiant compassion.</p>\r\n<p id=\"7b9c\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ie if gw ig b ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb gp bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">In her own opinion, Urvashi Vaid was a combination of hopeful idealism and grounded pragmatism and that shone in her decades-long journey and work as a lawyer, LGBTQ activist, writer, and social justice advocate. She worked at the oldest LGBT Civil Rights organization, the National LGBTQ Task Force, for 10 years- as a media director and then as the executive director. She founded LPAC, the first lesbian Super PAC, and the Vaid Group, a consultancy that would offer assistance to individuals as well as organizations to ensure equity and justice. She also authored two books-&lsquo;Virtual Equality: The Mainstreaming of Gay and Lesbian Liberation&rsquo; and &lsquo;Irresistible Revolution: Confronting Race, Class and the Assumptions of LGBT Politics&rsquo;. The enumeration of her many contributions could not be done justice in one paragraph.</p>\r\n<p id=\"d166\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ie if gw ig b ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb gp bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The focus of her activism strayed far beyond mainstream LGBTQ rights- she was a firm believer in the importance of intersectionality as well as economic advancement in the LGBTQ movement. In an interview that she gave alongside her wife Kate Clinton in 2014 at The Laura Flanders Show, she spoke against the prevalent overcriminalization in the justice system of the United States as well as her dream of &lsquo;socially responsible capitalism&rsquo;- an economic system that prioritized social justice alongside motives of profit-making. Her ambitions and hopes for the future were insatiable, and rightly so. In her acceptance speech for the 2014 GLAD Spirit of Justice Award, she appealed to the LBGTQ movement to not push the breaks at marriage equality and address the issues of poverty, sexism, transphobia, racism and so on that affected many people of the community:</p>\r\n<p id=\"35f8\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ie if gw ig b ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb gp bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><em class=\"jc\">&ldquo;The question facing the LGBT movement today is not &lsquo;Should</em>&nbsp;<em class=\"jc\">we fight for LBGT rights or LGBT liberation?&rsquo;. We have clearly done both. The</em>&nbsp;<em class=\"jc\">question that confronts the LGBT movement today is whether we are willing to</em>&nbsp;<em class=\"jc\">retool our movement to push for the redistribution of economic resources and</em>&nbsp;<em class=\"jc\">political power that is needed to change the lived experience of LBGT people in</em>&nbsp;<em class=\"jc\">all parts of our very diverse communities. Race, gender, and money; age,</em>&nbsp;<em class=\"jc\">ability and, HIV status are among the factors that constitute barriers to the</em>&nbsp;<em class=\"jc\">realization of full lived equality for many parts of our communities.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p id=\"8a49\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ie if gw ig b ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb gp bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The current atmosphere lucidly demonstrates that there&rsquo;s still a long, strenuous path to tread to reach the destination of the complete liberation of the LGBT community. Even though cancer stole away the gem of a person Urvashi Vaid, her legacy lives on. Her passing leaves a hollow dread inside everybody who knew both her and her ideas- but the hollowness is a reminder of how her work cannot be all in vain. In her 2012 book, &lsquo;Irresistible Revolution&rsquo;, she described the ambivalence engulfing the movement:</p>\r\n<p id=\"4a67\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ie if gw ig b ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb gp bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><em class=\"jc\">&lsquo;Despite the rather</em>&nbsp;<em class=\"jc\">personal pride I feel as a movement veteran in the achievements being won, I find myself more cautious than euphoric. This is a mixed moment for LGBT</em>&nbsp;<em class=\"jc\">liberation. We are making progress, and experiencing frustrating setbacks (such</em>&nbsp;<em class=\"jc\">as having to defend many legislative gains against ballot initiatives aimed at</em>&nbsp;<em class=\"jc\">their rescission). We are more visible than ever, and yet even today, large</em>&nbsp;<em class=\"jc\">numbers of our people remain closeted, silent, and uninvolved.&rsquo;</em></p>\r\n<p id=\"b150\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ie if gw ig b ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb gp bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Urvashi Vaid gave an impetus for many transformative and substantially needed changes, but the work does not stop with her. Her story is an eternal reminder for us to be courageous at all times, defiant when needed, and to keep working in the pursuit of fairness and justice with unwavering compassion. The abrasive wilderness she cleared up to create the path for progress and change cannot be left untended.</p>', 1, 'approved', 18, NULL, '2023-03-02 18:30:00', '2023-06-11 06:43:46'),

Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered military action on Ukraine to &ldquo;free&rdquo; the eastern regions of Donbas and Luhansk. The west immediately commenced putting forth sanctions while the Ukrainian army braced themselves for a long battle. The Ukrainian people have desperately tried leaving the country to cross over Polish, Romanian, and Hungarian borders among others. An underrepresented demographic of civilians in this war, however, has been a group of 20,000 Indian students and citizens stranded in the country with very little information about what steps to take. Two students have already lost their lives according to official numbers. These uncertain times have brought the uncomfortable question to the forefront &mdash; how are international students impacted in the time of crisis and how prepared are stakeholders in addressing their needs and safety during such uncertain times? A crisis can be defined as war, act of terrorism, natural or man-made disasters, pandemics/epidemics, recession etc.</p>\r\n<p id=\"e491\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ie if gw ig b ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb gp bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">For an increasing number of students, the place they call home is different from the place and country they spend years in for their education and career development. The people they meet, the food they eat, the language they speak is unfamiliar to the people they see around them.</p>\r\n<p id=\"f86e\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ie if gw ig b ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb gp bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">International students leave behind a culture and a people they understand and are faced with the daunting task of learning how to create an entirely new life in the US. To say this responsibility is difficult is certainly an understatement. Once-in-a-lifetime, large-scale events accentuate these difficulties and uncertainties even further for international students.</p>\r\n<p id=\"5639\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ie if gw ig b ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb gp bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Several global crisis have affected international students in the past as well. Due to the war in Gaza in 2009, Ben-Gurion University&rsquo;s Medical School for International Health with a student body of 165 international multicultural students canceled a week of classes that fostered fear, panic, and psychological stress. The 9/11 attacks created a uniquely challenging and tense environment especially for students from certain countries, backgrounds, and ethnicities. Homeland security in the US had especially at the time, severely threatened the mobility of students, scholars and researchers. At the same time, there were conflicting groups advocating for and against educational exchange that argued the value of such exchange altogether. Even during the pandemic, ICE said that international students whose universities go all-online in the fall would not be able to remain in the United States. The announcement was immediately met with uproar from students and universities alike. Students were fearful of returning to dangerous situations in their home countries and some even found it impossible or too expensive to self-deport.</p>\r\n<p id=\"9f71\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ie if gw ig b ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb gp bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">In most of these cases, there is not only no consideration given to the large demographic of international students from local governments and agencies but also a lack of structured support provided by embassies and other support systems. Even in the current situation in Ukraine, delays by the Indian government in communicating how bad the situation is and a lacking early response in getting students out of the country led to more than 20,000 students and citizens being stranded. Even today, it is expected that at least 8000 students are still trapped in Ukraine. In fact, government agencies are often found blaming students for not leaving the war-torn country and even their choice to study in international universities. As may or may not be in this case, general factors that often influence individuals&rsquo; decision to return/stay in the war zone are often of an academic and financial nature. Other factors included family pressure, information from peers and information from the administration. In dire situations such as these, concerns about transportation, food, and basic necessities for survival and security are responsibilities of embassies to provide and support with. Expecting students ridden with student debt to be able to pay for expensive tickets in a region about to enter war is far from working in the interest of students. Moreover, channels of communication from embassies, universities, student organizations are a matter of concern. It is also the responsibility of local authorities to ensure equitable access to emergency resources and avenues for safety. Racism, as claimed in the current situation of the Ukraine-Russia war, is commonplace.</p>\r\n<p id=\"ea3b\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ie if gw ig b ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb gp bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Additionally, there is a gradual recognition that International education and exchange programs are extensively influenced by the host country&rsquo;s foreign policy of the time. Recently in the US, the administration perceived a threat of Chinese students conducting espionage on US soil as a result of heightened tensions with China. As a result, the then-US President Donald Trump introduced the ban that effectively prevents graduate science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) students from several Chinese universities from gaining visas to the US. Being one of the biggest international student groups in the US, this impacted not only Chinese students but also universities. The Chinese students affected claim they aren&rsquo;t spies at all. Some even became so frustrated at the lack of clarity that they crowdfunded for a lawyer to start legal action against the US government. Such instances are innumerable.</p>\r\n<p id=\"3df0\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ie if gw ig b ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb gp bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The psychological stressors and trauma are even more profound in case of international students as are actual physical stressors. In the case of the above said example of the war in Gaza, many reported psychological difficulties during the war rather than physical danger. They described the period as &ldquo;draining&rdquo; and found it difficult to concentrate while studying. As foreigners, many felt their role was undefined. Although there was wide variation in the war&rsquo;s effect on daily activities and emotional well-being during that time, the majority (73%) reported minimal residual effects.</p>\r\n<p id=\"dde5\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ie if gw ig b ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb gp bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Even from the perspective of the host country, it is in their interest to ensure safety and equivalent priority to the international student demographic on humanitarian grounds as well as to encourage potential international students. The US is already witnessing a decline to the tune of 15% in international students at US universities. During the 2019&ndash;2020 school year, approximately 1,075,496 foreign-born students were enrolled at U.S. colleges and universities, representing 4.6% of the total U.S. student population. Students come to the U.S. from roughly 200 different countries, though more than half are from China and India. Canada is another example of high turnout of international students. International students are important not just to the success of domestic students, but to the success of colleges and universities. The number of high-school graduates across the United States is projected to increase by only 0.2% over the next nine years, compared to an increase of 6% over the previous nine years, according to new statistics recently released by the National Center for Education Statistics. That means international students are becoming increasingly important to keep classes full, tuition revenue up, and institutions thriving in addition to the fact that international students pay considerably higher tuition fee than their domestic counterparts.</p>\r\n<p id=\"7ed8\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ie if gw ig b ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb gp bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">So what are the needs of international students in case of a crisis? And who can give them that? Firstly, ensuring that international students are not the low hanging fruit for elimination when it comes to distribution and retention of basic resources &mdash; food, accommodation, wifi, and social security benefits. These are responsibilities of not only universities and university-driven international student agencies but also local governments. In addition, educating university entities with visa restrictions, resources to help students with visa-related resources and legal support is imperative. Understanding how students can continue their access to education in times like these is a responsibility of the universities and federal government agencies. This maybe through deferred degrees or online classes, if possible. Additionally, not only is uniform and unhindered access to embassies paramount, it is also crucial that embassies are proactive in understanding student issues at ground level and be sensitive to time especially during such infrequent uncertainties. Another stakeholder is the Institute of International Education (IIE) that has means to mobilize universities and channelise Emergency Student Funds through these universities. The IIE also has several other programs that will help in the long term &mdash; those that have helped in other impactful situations, such as Afghanistan and Haiti. These include placements for scholars to help them continue their academic careers, teaching and research. The IIE also has a protection program that helps place artists temporarily in art studios and museums.</p>\r\n<p id=\"628c\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ie if gw ig b ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb gp bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">In current times, the North American Association of Indian Students (NAAIS) recognises even more its importance as a blanket organization aimed to represent the needs of over 800,000 Indian-origin students in the US and Canada.</p>\r\n<p id=\"1b9d\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ie if gw ig b ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb gp bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Resources:</p>\r\n<ol class=\"\">\r\n<li id=\"ba66\" class=\"jc jd gw ig b ih ii il im ip je it jf ix jg jb jh ji jj jk bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><a class=\"ae jl\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/marvinkrislov/2019/03/22/why-international-students-are-good-for-colleges-universities-and-america/?sh=3b09f940f496\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/marvinkrislov/2019/03/22/why-international-students-are-good-for-colleges-universities-and-america/?sh=3b09f940f496</a></li>\r\n<li id=\"dd53\" class=\"jc jd gw ig b ih jm il jn ip jo it jp ix jq jb jh ji jj jk bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><a class=\"ae jl\" href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/30001939\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">https://www.jstor.org/stable/30001939</a></li>\r\n<li id=\"3965\" class=\"jc jd gw ig b ih jm il jn ip jo it jp ix jq jb jh ji jj jk bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><a class=\"ae jl\" href=\"https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/why-scores-indian-students-couldn-t-leave-ukraine-time-despite-advisories-161538\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/why-scores-indian-students-couldn-t-leave-ukraine-time-despite-advisories-161538</a></li>\r\n<li id=\"834c\" class=\"jc jd gw ig b ih jm il jn ip jo it jp ix jq jb jh ji jj jk bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><a class=\"ae jl\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/world/europe/indian-student-ukraine-death.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/world/europe/indian-student-ukraine-death.html</a></li>\r\n<li id=\"3edf\" class=\"jc jd gw ig b ih jm il jn ip jo it jp ix jq jb jh ji jj jk bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><a class=\"ae jl\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/06/asia/china-united-states-students-visa-ban-intl-hnk-dst/index.html#:~:text=Faced%20with%20the%20perceived%20threat,several%20Chinese%20universities%20from%20gaining\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/06/asia/china-united-states-students-visa-ban-intl-hnk-dst/index.html#:~:text=Faced%20with%20the%20perceived%20threat,several%20Chinese%20universities%20from%20gaining</a></li>\r\n<li id=\"815b\" class=\"jc jd gw ig b ih jm il jn ip jo it jp ix jq jb jh ji jj jk bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><a class=\"ae jl\" href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2022/03/indian-students-caught-in-the-warzone-in-ukraine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">https://thediplomat.com/2022/03/indian-students-caught-in-the-warzone-in-ukraine/</a></li>\r\n<li id=\"3e15\" class=\"jc jd gw ig b ih jm il jn ip jo it jp ix jq jb jh ji jj jk bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><a class=\"ae jl\" href=\"https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1240&amp;context=cehsedaddiss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1240&amp;context=cehsedaddiss</a></li>\r\n<li id=\"103f\" class=\"jc jd gw ig b ih jm il jn ip jo it jp ix jq jb jh ji jj jk bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><a class=\"ae jl\" href=\"https://universitybusiness.com/how-is-the-russia-ukraine-war-impacting-international-student-exchange/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">https://universitybusiness.com/how-is-the-russia-ukraine-war-impacting-international-student-exchange/</a></li>\r\n<li id=\"f28b\" class=\"jc jd gw ig b ih jm il jn ip jo it jp ix jq jb jh ji jj jk bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><a class=\"ae jl\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236688441_Foreign_Students\'_Experience_during_a_Time_of_War\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236688441_Foreign_Students\'_Experience_during_a_Time_of_War</a></li>\r\n</ol>', 1, 'approved', 36, NULL, '2023-03-04 18:30:00', '2023-06-11 06:54:03');

Currently, the student body is two-thirds white and just 8% of its students are eligible for federal Pell grants, a measure of economic status.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.coloradocollege.edu/admission/tuition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tuition alone is about $67,500 a year</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Pedro de Araujo, vice president and dean of the college, said the college has tried to rethink how to attract and graduate students from Colorado, including those who are from low-income families and students of color. He said the school plans to use its own data to illustrate how it helps students graduate and achieve social mobility. The U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings have not done well in explaining that, he said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is step one,&rdquo; de Araujo said. &ldquo;It is continuing to fulfill our antiracism commitment, continuing to look at our internal policies and see if they&rsquo;re not aligned with our values, and then start to change that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>U.S. News &amp; World Report will still rank the school, but based on publicly available data. That could mean the school may fall from its position as the 27th &ldquo;best&rdquo; liberal arts college.</p>\r\n<p>The U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings are provided as a way for families to make college decisions.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/15/us/us-news-college-ranking.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">But the rankings have drawn scrutiny for years</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Some college leaders have said the rankings favor reputation and institutional wealth over whether an education is top notch. Critics say the rankings even influence admission policies, leading schools to prioritize students with high SAT scores whose families can pay out of pocket without incurring debt, over recruiting diverse, well-rounded students. Colorado College officials say their admission policies have not been shaped by a desire for a higher ranking.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/how-us-news-calculated-the-rankings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The annual rankings judge colleges on 17 measures</a>, including graduation and retention rates, selectivity, and financial resources per student.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Reputation weighs heavily into the factors compared with measures such as whether schools improve students&rsquo; long-term socioeconomic status. Student debt also factors into the rankings, and critics say schools that admit wealthier students are more likely to rank highly on that metric.</p>\r\n<p>James Murphy of the college advocacy group Education Reform Now said there&rsquo;s no downside for a school to stop participating in the rankings, especially if they want to diversify their campus.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Racial and ethnic diversity play no role in the rankings as far as I can tell,&rdquo; said Murphy, the group&rsquo;s deputy director of higher education policy.</p>\r\n<p>The Colorado College student body is about two-thirds white; students from low-income families make up only a small portion. Recently the college has sought to become more representative of the state, de Araujo said.</p>\r\n<p>The school&nbsp;<a href=\"https://issuu.com/coloradocollege/docs/cc-com-antiracismplan-reviseddesign-2021?fr=sODc1NjM3MDExODY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">committed to becoming an antiracist campus</a>&nbsp;that pushes for more diversity and inclusion, such as programs and support for students and reviews of policies. It made&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.coloradocollege.edu/admission/for-students/admission-requirements/admission-test-optional.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">standardized testing optional</a>&nbsp;on applications, in the hopes it can attract students from different backgrounds. It is committed to support students from Colorado financially and so they don&rsquo;t pay more than&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.coloradocollege.edu/admission/financialaid/colorado-pledge.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the cost of attendance at the University of Colorado Boulder,</a>&nbsp;considered the state&rsquo;s premier public campus.</p>\r\n<p>The number of freshmen from low-income families has increased slightly, Murphy said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Not cooperating with the magazine rankings may cost some national visibility and out-of-state applications, Murphy said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s less likely to diminish applications from students from Colorado, students of color, or those from low-income families, he said.</p>\r\n<p>In its announcement, Colorado College said it would post online graduation and retention rates, diversity, and post-graduate success. The college has not said whether it would stop releasing student characteristics and other information that U.S. News &amp; World Report feeds into its rankings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>De Araujo said school leaders are committed to becoming more representative of the state and to help students.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is not one of those things where you have a checkbox, you check them and then you&rsquo;re done,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think pulling out of U.S. News was a good step forward.

Jared Polis.</p>\r\n<p>The proposals build on a program launched last year to offer up to two years of free college for Coloradans pursuing health care jobs. Already more than 2,000 students have enrolled, and leaders hope that with ongoing investment, they can reach many more.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;For every job-seeking person in Colorado, we need to get them the skills to match the amazing opportunities that our economy provides,&rdquo; Polis said.</p>\r\n<p>In the short term, the proposal expands on Colorado&rsquo;s system of free college options and the scholarships add to state-funded aid that help offset costs beyond high school.</p>\r\n<p>Long term, however, there&rsquo;s little guarantee future students will have the same opportunities, with only one-time money set aside for the proposals.</p>\r\n<p>During a news conference, Polis didn&rsquo;t commit to extending funding when it runs out. He also said he expects lawmakers to review which sectors need workers and to adjust programs to steer students into those fields.</p>\r\n<p>One $40 million proposal would make a two-year community college credential free in fields like elementary education, firefighting, policing, forestry, nursing and construction. The state would use one-time money this year to fund the program for two years.</p>\r\n<p>Colorado has shortages in those jobs. Some of the fields have low starting salaries, making it difficult to attract workers. But they&rsquo;re also jobs that have high social value.</p>\r\n<p>Polis said making the programs free will help attract students.</p>\r\n<p>He said, &ldquo;these are all professions that pay better than the unskilled workforce.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>For fields like teaching that require a four-year degree, the free college program would give students a way to get started on their education and save part of the cost.</p>\r\n<p>Lawmakers want the program to benefit over 20,000 Coloradans during the next two years.</p>\r\n<p>The program would cover the cost of enrollment plus books, supplies, and fees.</p>\r\n<p>The program would also cover any costs for training for apprenticeships in areas like the construction trades, including instructor time and instructional materials.</p>\r\n<p>The bill is sponsored by House Speaker Julie McCluskie, a Dillon Democrat, state Rep. Rose Pugliese, a Colorado Springs Republican, and state Sens. Janet Buckner, an Aurora Democrat, and Perry Will, a New Castle Republican.</p>\r\n<p>The second proposal would give scholarships to about a quarter of the graduating high school students in the Class of 2024.</p>\r\n<p>The state would provide 15,000 graduating students a roughly $1,500 scholarship each if they train or study for high-demand fields such as health care, manufacturing, engineering, education, or behavioral and mental health.</p>\r\n<p>The state already provides financial aid to most students who go to a community college or public university. But students could use the scholarship to pursue a wider range of options, including for an apprenticeship or on-the-job training.</p>\r\n<p>Bill sponsors include Senate Minority Leader Paul Lundeen, a Monument Republican, Sen. Jeff Bridges, a Greenwood Village Democrat, and Reps. Matthew Martinez, a Monte Vista Democrat, and Don Wilson, a Monument Republican.</p>\r\n<p>Unlike some states that offer free two-year college &mdash; such as Tennessee or Washington &mdash; Colorado has a patchwork of options for students to get free training or earn college credit.</p>\r\n<p>For example, Colorado high school students can earn a certificate in a high-demand field before they graduate. Students can also get college credit while in high school or take a fifth year of high school that offers college credit and is paid for by the state.</p>\r\n<p>And last year&rsquo;s Care Forward Colorado program has shown promise toward expanding free college for at least some fields.</p>\r\n<p>Last year, Polis and lawmakers pushed for free training in health care fields, a proposal that created the Care Forward program with $26 million in one-time federal pandemic relief aid.</p>\r\n<p>The program under the Colorado Community College System has enrolled over 2,000 students at a cost of about $6.1 million, according to system numbers. About 1,000 students have graduated in the first year from the community college system, according to the Colorado Department of Higher Education.</p>\r\n<p>Student participation has varied across the state&rsquo;s 13 colleges, with some schools enrolling over 500 students and others enrolling less than 100. The programs include pharmacy technician, nurse&rsquo;s aide, and dental assistant programs.</p>\r\n<p>Colorado Community College System Chancellor Joe Garcia said the expanded program would include money to market the free college programs. He said the state is collecting data on how the program serves students to someday make the case why these programs might need more funding.</p>\r\n<p>For now, the goal has been to ensure students can get job skills, work, and then go back to the community college system if they want to expand their knowledge &mdash; and eventually earn more money.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t just finish your education and go to a job,&rdquo; Garcia said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in stages.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s how Karlie Asman, 23, said it&rsquo;s worked for her under the Care Forward Colorado program.</p>\r\n<p>She said she got her EMT certification last year thanks to the program. She now works part time and volunteers in Franktown to get experience. And she&rsquo;s back in school again thanks to Care Forward in a paramedic preparation program, which will allow her to take on an expanded role in the health care field as well as earn more money.</p>\r\n<p>She added that thanks to Care Forward she doesn&rsquo;t have to worry about putting her money toward college costs and instead can focus on earning a living.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a huge, huge blessing for me,&rdquo; Asman said.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Jason Gonzales is a reporter covering higher education and the Colorado legislature.

Filling out the FAFSA can also provide funds for students who want to use a Next Level Jobs Workforce Ready Grant for a short- or long-term credential, because the grant could use federal Pell Grant dollars.</p>\r\n<p>The legislation would require all high schoolers to complete and submit the FAFSA by April 15 of their senior year, which is the deadline to be eligible for state aid in addition to federal aid.</p>\r\n<p>The bill includes exceptions for students at certain nonpublic schools, and for students who have a parent sign a waiver (emancipated minors can also sign it for themselves) to decline to complete the form. A school principal or counselor can also waive the requirement if they are unable to reach the student&rsquo;s parent or guardian by April 15 after &ldquo;at least two reasonable attempts.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>There was some concern about the bill during committee meetings. Rep. Tonya Pfaff, a Democrat, said during the vote that while she was supporting the bill, she still had concerns about the burdens on school counselors and wanted to work on that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>However, the exception in the bill to limit the attempts to reach families has eased that concern for others. And itcould give the bill crucial support, after years of unsuccessful attempts to require students to fill out the FAFSA.</p>\r\n<p>Completion of the FAFSA is considered a leading indicator of college-going.</p>\r\n<p>Just 53% of students in Indiana&rsquo;s Class of 2020 went on to college, and many Hoosiers see college as too expensive. In a statewide survey by the Indiana Department of Education, only 27% of parents said postsecondary education isaffordable.</p>\r\n<p>A state dashboard of FAFSA completion shows that about 36% of Indiana&rsquo;s high school seniors have completed a FAFSA.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not that there aren&rsquo;t efforts to get the word out from the state and other groups. Indiana has had College Goal Sunday, an in-person event to help families sign up, for more than 30 years.</p>\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean every student or family knows about the form or if it&rsquo;s for them. And schools with higher rates of students receiving free and reduced-price lunch tend to have the lower completion rates, said Josh Garrison, associate commissioner for public policy for the Indiana Commission for Higher Education, in a previous House education committee meeting.</p>\r\n<p>The legislation would make sure that filing out or not filling out the FAFSA is a choice, not happenstance of who found out about it, advocates of the bill said.</p>\r\n<p>They added that filling out the form can also help reduce student debt. FAFSA qualifies students for government loans that have lower interest rates than the private loans that they would get without the form, Garrison said.</p>\r\n<p>The committee meeting last week about the bill featured a show of support from organizations representing school boards, principals, and counselors, as well as public, private and community colleges in the state, and the Indiana and Indy chambers.</p>\r\n<p>MJ Slaby oversees Chalkbeat Indiana&rsquo;s coverage as bureau chief and covers higher education.

From time to time, I like to ask them how they\'re doing. But my check-ins aren\'t always welcome.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A student once asked, \"What did I do?\" when I reached out to him. He was only 13, but this Black male student had already learned to expect a reprimand when teachers called his name.</p>\r\n<p>Black students are constantly dealing with the effects of what Dr. Lamar L. Johnson, an associate professor at Michigan State University, calls racial violence. It teaches children like my 13-year-old student to confuse the attention of caring adults with punishment. In the classroom, this violence can play out through language and curriculum, too.</p>\r\n<p>Learning materials approved by the state and local school districts often omit critical conversations about the intersections of race, gender, religion, language, and sexuality. What\'s missing, in other words, is the lived experiences of students who are supposed to engage with the text.</p>\r\n<p>Instead, Black children are molded into a life that is not theirs. Many of the books I\'m told to teach to my kids center Eurocentric narratives and beliefs and whiteness. I am required to teach Abraham Lincoln and how he signed the Emancipation Proclamation, but not about the felony disenfranchisement that keeps many of my students\' families from experiencing true freedom.</p>\r\n<p>A recent NYU Metro Center report evaluated three commonly used elementary English Language Arts curricula: McGraw Hill\'s \"Wonders,\" Savvas Learning Company\'s \"myView,\" and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt\'s \"Into Reading.\"</p>\r\n<p>When students, parents, and educators from across the country assessed how the texts, teachers\' manuals, and lessons honored students\' diverse cultures and identities, they noted that the teachers\' manuals for all three curriculums rarely guided teachers to connect lessons to students\' lives. One evaluator observed, for example, that an elementary school teaching manual trivialized the devastation of colonialism and used dehumanizing language to describe Native Americans.</p>\r\n<p>The assessment\'s disappointing (but unsurprising) results suggest too many students spend their K-12 years without the affirmation and support they deserve.</p>\r\n<p>One approach to addressing racial violence and repairing the harm done to students of color is Becky Johnson\'s Teaching with Tenderness. This practice encourages educators to confront injustice directly while creating space for students\' emotions and experiences. It\'s an approach I have adopted in my classroom. Over the years, going from pre-service teaching to being one of the district\'s 2022 Outstanding Educator awardees, I have seen its transformative power.</p>\r\n<p>This approach encourages teachers to understand who is in their classroom and use this knowledge to build the curriculum. You can\'t center your students\' cultures and identities if you don\'t know their cultures and identities.</p>\r\n<p>What does this look like in practice? In 2019, I worked with my 11th graders to research our classroom\'s curriculum.</p>\r\n<p>We asked, \"Who is this book made for, and why?\" I won\'t soon forget our discussions. Students asked why the curriculum didn\'t include texts about powerful people who looked like us rather than \"sad stories that look down on Black people.\"</p>\r\n<p>We worked to improve the situation by compiling new resources, reshaping our lessons, and moving away from Eurocentric narratives in our classroom.</p>\r\n<p>Teaching with tenderness is one way to address some of the well-documented challenges in Detroit schools and across the nation. Eighty-two percent of Detroit Public Schools Community District students are Black, and 13.6% are Hispanic/Latino. My district\'s National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, test scores in math and reading are the lowest among big-city school districts for fourth and eighth grades. I have taught high school students reading on a third-grade level, and the majority of the students I engage are behind in literacy proficiency.</p>\r\n<p>My district also has one of the worst chronic absenteeism rates in the country. Almost 80% of Detroit district students were chronically absent &mdash; missing at least 10% of school days &mdash;in the 2021-2022 school year. Nationally in the same school year, at least one-third of students were on track to be chronically absent.</p>\r\n<p>While teachers and faculty are scrambling to keep students in their seats, systemic racism pushes many of our children out of school because they feel safer in their community than in the classroom. Culturally responsive curriculums &mdash; lessons in which students see themselves reflected &mdash; can nurture a sense of belonging, thereby improving student engagement, attendance, and academic performance.</p>\r\n<p>When children are not used to being loved wholeheartedly, their hypervigilance can perceive tenderness as a threat.</p>\r\n<p>Our children deserve love and dedication from highly trained teachers who can identify and dismantle racial violence. This requires fully funded schools and community-based wraparound services.</p>\r\n<p>We must not relent in the face of budget cuts, discipline disparities, and detractors who think softness is an unessential luxury. Tenderness can be the hardest skill to cultivate.</p>\r\n<p>Aneducator, steering committee co-chair, and curriculum lead for National Black Lives Matter at School, N\'Keng&eacute; Robertson is a voice for new, innovative educators in Detroit working to change educational paradigms for youth.

The new program will also give the university&rsquo;s 7,400 students more professional options.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our surveys find that almost half of Mines students have an interest in teaching,&rdquo; said Wendy Adams, director of the Teach@Mines program. &ldquo;Not all of those people, of course, are going to pursue it, but they&rsquo;re interested and so we just need to give them that option.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>She said when the program ramps up, she expects it to produce 20 to 30 teachers a year, mostly in science and computer science. Students will be able to complete the required education coursework and earn a state teaching license as part of a bachelor&rsquo;s or master&rsquo;s degree program.</p>\r\n<p>The School of Mines teacher prep program comes at a tenuous time for the education workforce.</p>\r\n<p>Nationwide, the pool of prospective teachers has been shrinking for over a decade as enrollment in teacher preparation programs has declined. Plus, teacher turnover rose in several states after years of pandemic-related stresses, according to a recent Chalkbeat analysis.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The way we see it we really have a responsibility to the state to offer teacher licensure because there&rsquo;s 7,000 students at Mines, some of the best STEM students in the state, and to not provide them a pathway to become a teacher is basically removing them from the pipeline,&rdquo; Adams said.</p>\r\n<p>The university&rsquo;s journey toward teacher preparation began in 2015. That&rsquo;s when it partnered with the Greeley-based University of Northern Colorado, which runs the state&rsquo;s largest teacher preparation program, to provide a route for Mines students who wanted to teach.</p>\r\n<p>Students would complete science and math coursework at the School of Mines and take most teaching classes online through the University of Northern Colorado. Twenty-two students completed the program and earned teaching licenses before the program ended last year.</p>\r\n<p>Adams said the partnership was good, but tricky.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There were just so many different competing things from an administrative perspective that it didn&rsquo;t function as well as it could have,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n<p>School of Mines leaders decided to bring the teacher preparation program in-house a few years ago. The university began offering education courses in 2019 and now offers the full menu of options. The State Board vote on Wednesday means that Mines is now a state-approved teacher preparation program and that those who complete it are eligible for teaching licenses in Colorado.</p>\r\n<p>Adams said about 85 Mines students are enrolled in one or more education classes at the university, with about half of those seriously interested in becoming teachers.</p>\r\n<p>She said she knows of Mines students who&rsquo;ve done computer science or engineering internships but haven&rsquo;t found the work satisfying.</p>\r\n<p>One student, she said, worried that his computer science specialty would most likely lend itself to a job in the weapons industry.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t want to do that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He wants to help people and help students so he&rsquo;s going to be a teacher.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Ann Schimke is a senior reporter at Chalkbeat, covering early childhood issues and early literacy.

Educators say those issues are still present this school year, but note many students are struggling in quieter ways, such as finding it hard to interact with their peers or engage in class.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Last year, I was talking a lot about kids just walking out &mdash; it was a constant,&rdquo; said Alex Maga&ntilde;a, executive director of Beacon Network Schools in Denver, Colorado. &ldquo;But now, you see a higher percentage of kids that just sit there, not engaging.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Behavioral challenges are not new to schools, but with the pandemic introducing additional trauma and stressors, educators fear they&rsquo;ve become more prevalent. Even as some schools have strengthened support systems, teachers say it hasn&rsquo;t always been enough to meet student needs &mdash; and experts warn the long-lasting effects on students are not yet fully understood.</p>\r\n<p>In Chicago, schools saw a roughly 48% drop in serious or criminal misconduct at schools this year, but at the same time, more minor disruptive behaviors were on the rise. And while similar numbers are not available nationwide, nearly 70% of educators surveyed last fall said behavioral disruptions had increased since the 2019-20 school year, according to a report by EAB, an education consulting firm. (The survey drew from more than 1,000 educators across 42 states, but was not a nationally representative sample.)</p>\r\n<p>Since 2018, the share of educators reporting frequent opposition and emotional disconnection among students saw significant jumps, according to the EAB survey. Those findings follow a May 2022 National Center for Education Statistics survey that found more than 80% of public schools had noticed slower behavioral and socio-emotional development in students amid the pandemic &mdash; and as educators on the EAB survey reported smaller but still notable increases in observed bullying and violence.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Schooling was really inconsistent for a lot of students across the pandemic,&rdquo; said Olivia Rios, an associate director at EAB. &ldquo;They just haven&rsquo;t had the chance, or the time, or the opportunities, to develop those skills that you need to sit in a chair and productively learn throughout the day.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Of course, educators struggled with behavioral challenges well before the pandemic, she added. Indicators of student mental health, too, had been declining for years.</p>\r\n<p>Rios said educators have told her this year has been less chaotic than the last, with students also exhibiting less severe disruptive behavior. But concerns remain over the long-term impact of the pandemic on students&rsquo; self-regulation skills, she added.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The temperature has come down a little bit,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But even if the outbursts aren&rsquo;t quite as big as they were last year, they&rsquo;re still there, and we&rsquo;re still having trouble resetting kids and getting them back into the mindset of being ready to learn.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s an issue that some educators and students have seen locally, though experiences vary widely even within a school.</p>\r\n<p>For 14-year-old Kiara Rodriguez, a ninth grader at Grover Cleveland High School in Queens, New York, this school year hasn&rsquo;t felt different from the last. Many students still aren&rsquo;t listening in class, and with friction between teachers and students, it can be difficult to focus, she said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I kind of want to go back to online school,&rdquo; Rodriguez said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too much.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Omar Ramirez, also a ninth grader at Grover Cleveland, has had a different experience. He said some students have been distracted, but the year has gone smoothly &mdash; adding he hasn&rsquo;t seen any especially disruptive behavior around school.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The students have been in control,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nothing really crazy has been going on.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Dan Walsh, principal of Kepner Beacon Middle School in Denver, said what teachers at his school are reporting &ldquo;is more of a shift in the ratio.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Not that the behaviors that are happening are more intense, it&rsquo;s just that the number of kids that are experiencing those challenges has increased,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>Jennifer Spencer, a lead interventionist at the Distinctive Schools network in Michigan, said she&rsquo;s seen widespread frustration from students as they attempt to navigate their classes after losing academic ground during the pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve lost that control and understanding that when they come to the classroom, they have to be ready to learn,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just all over the place.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>And the impact hasn&rsquo;t just been felt inside of the classroom. Danyelle Kimp, a teacher at Alcorn Middle School in Columbia, South Carolina, said students at his school have struggled to socialize with one another, even more than a year after returning to an in-person learning environment.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Online communication was the norm for a year and a half,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So it just seems like some of the kids are awkward and don&rsquo;t know how to interact with each other, let alone teachers or other adults.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Alex Driver, a teacher at Pace High School in New York City, said he&rsquo;s noticed an uptick in how many students struggle with social anxiety.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always been kids who are reticent to speak in front of the class,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s probably five times as many these days.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Though his students haven&rsquo;t struggled with outbursts, he noted they&rsquo;ve been more distracted, with cell phone use being particularly disruptive in class.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s never been a period that goes by that I don&rsquo;t have to say, &lsquo;Put away your phone,&rsquo; like 15 or 16 times,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>The EAB survey also highlighted a disconnect between teachers and school administrators when it came to addressing behavior issues in the classroom. It indicated that school administrators overestimated how much training staff and teachers had received &mdash; with more than 70% of administrators stating their staff had been trained in various behavioral management techniques, while 53% or fewer teachers reported that was the case.</p>\r\n<p>Ben Court, a senior director at EAB, said ensuring teachers and administrators are on the same page is &ldquo;the most important first piece of this puzzle.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;One of the things that we know is incredibly important for students is consistent response from teachers between classrooms,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The more variation we have, the more chaotic it can be, the harder for them it can be to know how to respond.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>To Driver, the behavioral shifts in recent years have heightened the importance of support systems in schools.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;More kids than ever need the counselors at our school,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A lot of kids have trauma &hellip; but I have tons of kids who will ask to go see the counselor, and not because they&rsquo;re in crisis. The counselor will say, &lsquo;She just wants to talk every day.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Julian Shen-Berro is a reporter covering national issues.

If enough students need transportation to the Capitol, she will look for ways to provide it.</p>\r\n<p>She is also asking students to write letters and sign a petition asking Congress to renew the provisions of the Immigration Act of 1929. The act was intended to provide a way for immigrants who have been in the country for many years to earn legal status. But its required dates for entry haven&rsquo;t been updated recently, so most immigrants do not qualify.

After she moved in with them, they formally adopted her.</p>\r\n<p>When Chavez moved to Denver at age 18, she enrolled at GALS, a Denver charter school.</p>\r\n<p>Back in Guatemala, she had been forced to drop out of school after second grade. When she started school in the U.S., she didn&rsquo;t speak English. A year after enrolling in high school, the pandemic shut down school buildings. That meant she also was forced to learn technology on top of everything else so she could continue working toward her diploma online.</p>\r\n<p>But she managed to graduate earlier than planned, last spring.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Basically I knew nothing,&rdquo; Chavez said. &ldquo;I had a ton of obstacles, you could say that, but nothing stopped me from achieving what I had set out to achieve.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Chavez applied to multiple universities, and was accepted at all but one.

She says she&rsquo;s discovered a passion for helping others. Her mom back in Guatemala tells her it&rsquo;s like she&rsquo;s a new person.</p>\r\n<p>Chavez tells her it&rsquo;s because she is. Having time to spend on learning, instead of working all day, has allowed her to see the world through a different lens, she said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I have felt more safe. I have felt more valuable as a woman. I have felt truly fortunate to be in a country that can offer me safety,&rdquo; Chavez said.</p>\r\n<p>And helping others feel the most joy out of being in a place of safety matters to her.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing it out of the love I have for the community,&rdquo; Chavez said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing it from the bottom of my heart.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Yesenia Robles is a reporter for Chalkbeat Colorado covering K-12 school districts and multilingual education.

The measure, House Bill 999, includes a provision that would end funding for diversity, equity and inclusion programs at state colleges and universities.</p>\r\n<p>The roundtable opened with a video mashup of clips from Fox News and the conservative website Campus Reform among others that were designed to illustrate what the governor and his panelists later called a &ldquo;pernicious&rdquo; ideology. The presentation showed students attacked for questioning &ldquo;transgenderism&rdquo; and being required to take courses in New York on racial equity. It included clips of diversity &ldquo;bureaucrats&rdquo; in Michigan said to be making millions and an English professor at Florida International University using the term &ldquo;Latinx&rdquo; instead of Latino or Latina.</p>\r\n<p>It also presented findings from Chris Rufo, a conservative activist who has helped shape some of Florida&rsquo;s education policies and was appointed by DeSantis to the New College Board of Trustees. Rufo has taken to Twitter in recent weeks, citing public documents to deride diversity, equity and inclusion programs at a number of Florida universities.</p>\r\n<p>For example, he has called out an endocrinology program at the University of Florida that offers gender-affirming care and a social justice badge program at Florida International University.</p>\r\n<p>Also during the roundtable, DeSantis accused universities of underreporting what they spend on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in response to a request from his budget office. Together, the universities said they spend about $35 million on such programs, but the governor said he believed it was &ldquo;significantly higher.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>He said universities were right aim for diversity and &ldquo;making sure that people from different walks of life are able to participate. But he added: &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s been used in the administrative apparatus of universities to try to impose not diversity of thought, but to try to impose uniformity of thought. And instead of inclusion, the people that dissent from this orthodoxy are actually excluded and marginalized.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Joined by nine panelists, DeSantis worked to show that diversity initiatives were &ldquo;indoctrinating&rdquo; students and lowering standards. The group included Rufo; New College board of trustees chairperson Debra Jenks; Scott Yenor, a fellow at the conservative Claremont Institute; conservative analyst Carrie Sheffield; Florida International University trustee chair Rogelio (Roger) Tovar; State University System Chancellor Ray Rodrigues; education commissioner Manny Diaz, Jr.; and two students from Florida State University and the University of South Florida.</p>\r\n<p>Rodrigues and DeSantis acknowledged that Florida implemented diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the university system in the summer of 2020 after the murder of George Floyd. But while the intentions were good, they said, the results were not.</p>\r\n<p>With the &ldquo;passage of time&rdquo; came a &ldquo;new perspective&rdquo; and &ldquo;a clear recognition that a course correction is intended,&rdquo; DeSantis said.</p>\r\n<p>The push for diversity, equity and inclusion has &ldquo;become a means to advocate a political ideology of the left,&rdquo; Rodrigues said, &ldquo;and it has ignored merit and instead sought to provide equal outcomes, not based on the merit of the individual or the work, but instead on their physical characteristics, which is exclusionary, not inclusive.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Panel member Aleyda &ldquo;Ally&rdquo; Matamoros, an engineering student at the University of South Florida, said she experienced rejection from student groups because of her conservative views.</p>\r\n<p>The governor asked her how she felt diversity initiatives were impacting the quality of her education. Matamoros said she didn&rsquo;t think it helped. She said her engineering professors often tell students that one calculation mistake could cost hundreds of lives.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I feel like moving away from merit-based systems and focusing solely on the superficial and the fact that we need to have diversity, you&rsquo;re opening up the fact that more of these mistakes can happen&hellip;. and it could lead to a lot of dangerous things down the road,&rdquo; Matamoros said.</p>\r\n<p>At the first hearing on House Bill 999, where 150 people had signed up to speak, bill sponsor Alex Andrade faced a series of pointed questions from four House Democrats. At the core of their concerns was removing curriculum related to critical race theory, gender studies and diversity, equity and inclusion programs.</p>\r\n<p>Christine Andrews-Larson, a professor at Florida State University, said provisions concerning spending on diversity could preclude Florida universities from eligibility for major research grants. At FSU, that could mean returning 30 to 50 percent of their grants, she said.</p>\r\n<p>Andrew Gothard, chair of the statewide faculty union, said he spoke on behalf of faculty, and asked the committee to vote the bill down.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You can vote for freedom or you can vote for fascism,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p><em>Divya Kumar is a higher education reporter for the Tampa Bay Times, in partnership with Open Campus</em>.</p>', 1, 'approved', 0, NULL, '2023-03-13 00:00:00', '2023-03-18 07:37:24'),

He&rsquo;s a democracy fellow with CSU&rsquo;s Office of Civic Engagement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One of his recent projects was crafting a social media post outlining what this legislation means for his peers. Like Samsa, most of Cleveland State&rsquo;s students come from Ohio, though there are a growing number of international students and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.csuohio.edu/admissions/schoolvisits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">an uptick in recruiting effort</a>s targeting states such as New York and Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Students who support these new laws may consider the changes a plus as they weigh staying in the state versus moving, he said. But not everyone may share those feelings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If they do see it as an inconvenience to voting or anything like that, any negative, that kind of comes to represent the entire state as a whole,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Samsa pointed out there are already barriers impacting all college students, like finding time in their packed schedules to vote. Forty-two percent of Gen-Z and 30% of Millennials said they &ldquo;forgot or were too busy&rdquo; to participate in the 2022 midterms,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/gen-z-aware-its-power-wants-have-impact-wide-range-issues\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">according to data</a>&nbsp;from the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are other challenges, too, including securing transportation to an off-campus polling location and securing childcare for student-parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Collegians aren&rsquo;t the only group affected by these changes. The Ohio chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union<a href=\"https://twitter.com/acluohio/status/1632758787936272392\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&nbsp;called the legislation</a>&nbsp;&ldquo;anti-voter&rdquo; because it will add barriers for people to vote and could discourage them altogether. The ACLU said the law is one of the strictest voter ID measures in the country.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Roughly eight in 10 Americans polled in a July 2021&nbsp;<a href=\"http://maristpoll.marist.edu/?p=48606\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey</a>&nbsp;supported requiring photo identification to vote. Those results were cited&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ohiosos.gov/media-center/press-releases/2023/2023-01-06/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">in a January news release</a>&nbsp;from Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, who called these stricter requirements a &ldquo;common-sense way&rdquo; that &ldquo;ensures voters are not disenfranchised.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This legislation brings other changes, too, including axing August special elections, getting rid of early voting on the Monday before Election Day, and shortening the window for absentee voting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of moving parts. And that&rsquo;s the biggest barrier Anita Ruf-Young sees as the director of Cleveland State&rsquo;s Office of Civic Engagement. The office does not tell students who or what to vote for, she said, stressing it&rsquo;s a strictly nonpartisan effort. All of the work goes into helping students figure out how to cast a ballot.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;A lot of these college students are just voting for the first time, or about to, and all of a sudden, they&rsquo;re trying to figure out all this information,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://spectrumnews1.com/oh/columbus/news/2023/01/12/groups-express-concern-over-new-voter-id-requirements-in-hb-458\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Though there are challenges</a>&nbsp;to this new law, it&rsquo;s currently set to go into effect a few days after Ohio&rsquo;s voter registration deadline of April 3. This gives time to get more context out ahead of May&rsquo;s primary elections for all Ohio residents, including collegians.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ruf-Young and her team at Cleveland State, for example, will continue doing things such as staffing those voter registration and information tables, providing current information online, and supplying hard copies of resources to the campus&rsquo; library to help students make their voting plans.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If we get them to participate now, they&rsquo;re more likely to participate for the rest of their lives,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Amy Morona covers higher education for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://signalcleveland.org/\">Signal Cleveland</a>,&nbsp;in partnership with Open Campus.</em></p>', 1, 'approved', 0, NULL, '2023-03-18 07:39:10', '2023-03-18 07:39:10'),

At the same time, he said he understands why money is a sensitive subject.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I totally respect the reason that folks are really concerned about the funding formula is that higher education is way underfunded in this state, just severely underfunded,&rdquo; Taggart said. &ldquo;If you start messing with the formula, you&rsquo;re going to rob Peter to pay Paul.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>For university leaders, the bill did place <a href=\"https://co.chalkbeat.org/2020/6/1/21277566/colorado-outcomes-based-higher-education-funding-formula-puts-focus-on-students\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">funding under the microscope</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Supporters such as Colorado Mesa University President John Marshall said he hoped the designation would kick off a larger conversation about the money schools need to educate first-generation students who often need more support. Colorado Mesa University and Metropolitan State University of Denver supported the bill and would have almost immediately earned the first generation-serving designation.</p>\r\n<p>In a statement, MSU Denver President Janine Davidson said the school was proud to stand behind the bill.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;While we&rsquo;re disappointed it didn&rsquo;t pass, we remain committed to making MSU Denver a vibrant home for those trailblazing students who are the first in their families to go to college,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Opponents such as Colorado State University System Chancellor Tony Frank said during committee testimony that other schools also serve students who are the first in their family to go to college in their family. He worried that the designation would create unfair considerations later on. A CSU System spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.</p>\r\n<p>The bill passed the House Education Committee unanimously last month, but Taggart and co-sponsor state Rep. Serena Gonzales-Guttierez, a Denver Democrat, pulled the bill from consideration before a full House vote last week.</p>\r\n<p>Taggart said schools should get recognized for what they do for students, and students should know about their options. For example, schools whose student populations are 25% Hispanic or more are <a href=\"https://co.chalkbeat.org/2021/10/26/22747703/university-of-colorado-denver-anschutz-hispanic-serving-institution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">designated Hispanic-Serving Institutions</a>. However, that federal designation does come with extra money. Other schools or programs might get special designations for what they&rsquo;ve accomplished, Taggart said.</p>\r\n<p>Taggart hopes he can find more agreement when he brings the bill back next year. Educating first-generation students will be a big part of how Colorado gets a more educated population, he said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I am disappointed because this evolved into a funding discussion rather than sticking to a designation that these universities deserve,&rdquo; Taggart said.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chalkbeat.org/authors/jason-gonzales\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Jason Gonzales</em></a><em> is a reporter covering higher education and the Colorado legislature.

Under the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.boston.gov/departments/assessing/payment-lieu-tax-pilot-program\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">voluntary program</a>, which launched in fiscal year 2012, the city requests that nonprofits with more than $15 million in tax-exempt property make specific, individualized contributions in cash each fiscal year, with deductions of about 50% offered for services that benefit city residents, such as job training programs or academic scholarships.</p>\r\n<p>The 21 participating schools and colleges &mdash; which include institutions such as Harvard, Boston and Northeastern universities &mdash; met 69% of Boston&rsquo;s requested PILOT payment in fiscal year 2021, providing about $14.6 million in cash and $30 million in credited community benefits. In all, the city received about $90.5 million that fiscal year from 47 nonprofits, 77% of the amount it had requested.</p>\r\n<p>Though the city would like to see nonprofits meet the requests in full and would prefer greater cash contributions over community benefits credits, &ldquo;the program has been really successful,&rdquo; with strong participation from nonprofits, said Nick Ariniello, commissioner of assessing for Boston. The city is more focused on maintaining relationships and participation than increasing the already high level of engagement, he said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve kind of reached this equilibrium where the major players contribute or they&rsquo;ve made determinations not to,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that we don&rsquo;t keep asking them, but they&rsquo;re unlikely to change their minds or change their levels of contribution at this point.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Boston makes its requests to each nonprofit public, whether they pay it or not, and the roster of those who pay is something that the city points to when having conversations with other nonprofits.</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"community-organizing-in-new-haven\">Community organizing in New Haven</h3>\r\n<p>Yale University previously contributed $13 million annually to New Haven, almost matching&nbsp; what the 21 education institutions paid in cash to Boston in fiscal year 2021. But in November, the university pledged to increase its payments by $52 million over six years, for a total contribution of about $135 million during that period.</p>\r\n<p>The university upped its payment following activism and pressure from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yalerespectnewhaven.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">community organizers</a>, said Adam Marchand, a member of New Haven&rsquo;s Board of Alders and chair of its finance committee. While Yale&rsquo;s previous contribution was valuable, there was still a &ldquo;huge gulf&rdquo; between that and the amount the university would pay if its educational properties were fully taxable, he said.</p>\r\n<p>That same organizing also led to changes at the state level, he said, as Connecticut has more than doubled the amount it provides New Haven annually through the state&rsquo;s PILOT&nbsp;<a href=\"https://portal.ct.gov/OPM/IGPP/Grants/PILOT/Colleges-and-Hospitals-PILOT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reimbursement program</a>. Now, New Haven will take in about $90 million from the state each year.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It has really pulled us out of a fiscal crisis. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that we&rsquo;re wealthy as a city because we still have all the usual structural costs,&rdquo; Marchand said of the increases. &ldquo;But our fiscal house is in much better order.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"individual-and-collective-contributions-in-providence\">Individual and collective contributions in Providence&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>Further to the northeast, in Providence, Rhode Island, agreements with nonprofit hospitals and universities generated about $8.1 million in revenue for the city in fiscal year 2021. The city&rsquo;s largest nonprofits own about 28% of city property and would contribute more than $130 million extra each year if they were taxable, according to a January 2022 report.</p>\r\n<p>Brown University, the Rhode Island School of Design [RISD], Providence College and Johnson and Wales University entered a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.brown.edu/gcr/sites/gcr/files/2003_MOU.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nonbinding agreement</a>&nbsp;with the city in 2003, agreeing to pay at least $48.5 million through June 2023. This fiscal year&rsquo;s payment is set to bring in about $2.3 million to Providence.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The institutions were able to guarantee for the city that kind of revenue stream,&rdquo; said Dan Egan, president of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Rhode Island. &ldquo;Beyond the predictability, the generosity just was a signal of the relationship between the institution and its host community.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Nine years later, the four universities entered&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Review-of-RI-PILOT-Agreements-Narrative-September-29-2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">individual agreements</a>&nbsp;with the city, at that time signing on to pay $44.2 million more collectively over about a decade. In exchange, the city allowed Brown and RISD to use 320 public parking spaces near their campuses and conveyed the titles to about 146,000 square feet in city-owned streets to Brown and Providence College.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Pitt did not directly respond to a question from PublicSource regarding why the university has not negotiated a similar voluntary payment agreement with the city or county.</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"apples-and-oranges\">Apples and oranges?</h3>\r\n<p>City Controller Michael Lamb said in a statement that there are &ldquo;many&rdquo; valuable models for PILOT agreements, and Pittsburgh&rsquo;s relationships with its nonprofits will vary by institution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Pittsburgh needs to do what works best for our residents, who are currently bearing the burden, with the goal of making sure that everyone pays their fair share and the nonprofits are contributing to the operations of city government,&rdquo; Lamb said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Municipalities can create more successful PILOT programs when they provide justification for the financial contributions they seek, allow reductions in cash contributions in exchange for new services and ensure that they&rsquo;ll protect the institutions&rsquo; tax-exempt status, said Daphne Kenyon, a local public finance expert at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Prominent universities may be more inclined to engage in PILOT agreements if they see that other universities have already done so, Kenyon said, but municipalities in poorer financial condition can make a stronger appeal for PILOTs than those that aren&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n<p>During the pandemic, Pittsburgh has balanced its budget with the help of federal relief funding, but the money must be allocated by the end of 2024 and spent through 2026. In an April interview, Lamb said he doesn&rsquo;t know if other sources of revenue will increase in the next two years to offset the loss.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Adam Langley, an expert at the Lincoln Institute, told PublicSource in May that the OnePGH initiative could be one of the most lucrative agreements in the country if the $115 million in pledges are realized. The initiative provides more control to nonprofits than typical PILOTs, and that control could have resulted in greater contributions, he said.</p>\r\n<p>Acting Allegheny County Controller Tracy Royston said in a statement that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.erienewsnow.com/story/33999943/harborcreek-supervisors-approve-pilot-deal-with-penn-state-behrend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Penn State Behrend&rsquo;s PILOT</a>&nbsp;&ndash; through which the university pays 50% of the tax rate for developed land and the full amount for undeveloped land to Erie County, Harborcreek Township and the local school district &ndash; is notable as a nearby example of an agreement. She added that its limits on what parts of campus are subject to payments are&nbsp; not ideal. Instead, Yale&rsquo;s agreement with New Haven may be a better model, she said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It would be worth looking more closely at how they came to that agreement,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n<p>For Sarah Gallop, co-director of the Office of Government and Community Relations at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, agreements should be viewed individually, taking into account the broader context of a city and its relationship with a university. They&rsquo;re &ldquo;all apples to oranges,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t be looked at in a silo and without the context of other contributions, the complexities of the city or the town that the university is in,&rdquo; Gallop said. &ldquo;Ultimately, it&rsquo;s the municipality and the university that need to decide what is it that&rsquo;s best for the university, for the town.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"sensible-features-and-state-support\">&lsquo;Sensible&rsquo; features and state support</h3>\r\n<p>Some municipalities receive additional aid and have voluntary payment agreements with features that could be valuable for others.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As part of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cambridgema.gov/-/media/Files/CDD/Planning/TownGown/pilot_agreements/pilot_agreement_mit_2004.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MIT&rsquo;s agreement</a>, the university must make additional payments if it removes property from the city&rsquo;s tax rolls. The payments, which are based on what the property would contribute in taxes the year it became exempt, increase by 3% each year. For some properties, MIT can make gradually decreasing payments over four years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The university receives credit for adding properties back onto the rolls and for giving notice to the city when it will convert property from taxable to tax-exempt, too, according to the agreement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s flexible, so it&rsquo;s good for MIT. But it&rsquo;s also predictable,&rdquo; Gallop said. &ldquo;The city can plan for that revenue loss, and then also, the city can plan for revenue increases as we purchase property or turn property into taxable uses. And it works really, really well for both parties.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>MIT is set to contribute at least $101.4 million to Cambridge over 40 years through the decadeslong agreement the university entered with the city in 2004. The city received about $8.1 million in PILOT revenue in fiscal year 2021, about $2.2 million of which came from MIT.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In Providence, the universities also agreed in 2003 to make annual, decreasing payments to the city for 15 years if they purchase taxable property that becomes exempt under their ownership. Yale announced in November that it will make steadily decreasing payments over 12 years on property that becomes tax-exempt in the next six years.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That tapering off of that payment seems completely sensible,&rdquo; Kenyon said. &ldquo;I just think it would make for a happier town-gown relationship because universities need to expand from time to time. Do you want the city or town fighting them?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>PILOTs that provide additional payments when land becomes tax-exempt under nonprofit ownership could help ensure that local governments can continue to provide the same level of services, Royston said.</p>\r\n<p>Providence, like Connecticut, receives aid from the state, which runs a program that reimburses up to 27% of nonprofits&rsquo; property tax liability. The program generated about $34 million for the city in fiscal year 2021.</p>\r\n<p>A state program like those in Rhode Island and Connecticut would enable municipalities to automatically receive reimbursements from the state instead of negotiating individual agreements with nonprofits, but the funding could be unreliable due to state budget problems, Royston said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;In assessing the value of a state PILOT program, we would consider how it&rsquo;s paid for, the reliability of the funding and whether it would also provide payments to the county and school districts,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Connecticut&rsquo;s program has helped New Haven improve its fiscal standing, Marchand said, but he noted that the funding is still coming from taxpayers, not Yale or other universities.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s there, it&rsquo;s running, the fact that it&rsquo;s generating more money for the city is a good thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The people in the community, as glad as they were for that, they also kept their eyes on Yale.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"mutual-objectives\"><strong>&lsquo;Mutual objectives&rsquo;</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Both government and university representatives agreed that fostering positive relationships and working together were key to developing PILOT agreements. Municipalities should be transparent, thoughtful and willing to collaborate, and they shouldn&rsquo;t rush the process, Gallop said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very important for MIT that Cambridge is healthy. It&rsquo;s also very important to Cambridge that MIT is healthy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You have to establish the mutual objectives. You need a healthy university, you need a healthy city. So, how are we going to get there?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Gallop views MIT&rsquo;s 40-year agreement with Cambridge as one of the &ldquo;least important&rdquo; ways the university contributes to the city, instead finding its work in the community more beneficial .</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, Boston&rsquo;s Ariniello said PILOT contributions help the city provide services and&nbsp; be more responsive to residents&rsquo; needs &mdash; which the major nonprofits benefit from, too, he said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s the patients at the hospitals or students at the universities, they all take advantage of those services and take advantage of the benefits that a city can have,&rdquo; Ariniello said. &ldquo;Everything that you can do to kind of add that stability and security to your local municipality is really allowing them to provide benefits back to you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Lamb said in April that he&rsquo;d like the city to have new PILOT agreements with its nonprofits in place by 2024. To his knowledge, the city&rsquo;s major nonprofits remain open to discussion, he said in a statement.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;On behalf of taxpayers, I am grateful that everyone is willing to come to the table,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p><em>Emma Folts covers higher education at PublicSource, in partnership with Open Campus.

NAAIS breaks it down.', '<p>Most international students studying in the U.S. have an F-1 visa, which allows you to enter the country as a full-time student at an accredited college, university, or a number of other academic institutions and training programs. You must be enrolled in a program or course of study that culminates in a degree, diploma, or certificate and your school must be authorized by the U.S. government to accept international students.</p>\r\n<p>When studying in the U.S. on an F-1 visa, getting a job is a great way to gain work experience while also earning money to put towards tuition or living expenses. However, regulations on your F-1 visa may limit where and when you can work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>During the first academic year, students can only work on-campus; after the first year, the range of legal job opportunities broadens to include Curricular Practical Training and Optional Practical Training.</p>\r\n<p>Depending on how long you have been studying in the US, you may be legally allowed to work in all or only one of the three main ways.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>On-Campus Employment</strong></h2>\r\n<p>On-campus employment is the easiest option for F-1 students, and is the only legal option for those in their first academic year. On-campus employment can take place on the school&rsquo;s campus or at an off-campus location that is <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/sevis/employment\">educationally affiliated</a> with the school. This includes typical student jobs in the libraries, dining halls, dorms, or other on-campus locations along with certain off-campus locations affiliated with the school, such as research labs.</p>\r\n<p>The hours for on-campus employment are limited to 20 hours per week while school is in session, but students can work full-time when school is out of session. You are allowed to work in more than one on-campus job, but their combined hours each week still cannot be more than 20.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Curricular Practical Training (CPT)</strong></h2>\r\n<p>After the first academic year, F-1 students are allowed to do <a href=\"https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/sevis-help-hub/student-records/fm-student-employment/f-1-curricular-practical-training-cpt\">Curricular Practical Training</a> (CPT), which is training that is a required part of your school&rsquo;s curriculum and relates to your major of study. CPT is meant to give you actual experience in your major, like an internship, co-op, or practicum, and can be full-time with no hourly limit each week.</p>\r\n<p>Some schools may offer Day 1 CPT, which allows students to do CPT from the first day of their program instead of waiting one year. The number of programs offering this is low, and it typically only applies to master&rsquo;s and doctoral degree programs, but it may be an option for some F-1 students.</p>\r\n<p>In order to do CPT, students must first secure the training opportunity, then gain approval from their Designated School Official (DSO). Students can have more than one CPT authorization at the same time, but keep in mind that one year of full-time CPT will eliminate a student&rsquo;s Optional Practical Training eligibility.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Optional Practical Training (OPT)</strong></h2>\r\n<p>In addition to becoming eligible for CPT, F-1 students are also allowed to do <a href=\"https://www.interstride.com/blog/optional-practical-training-opt-for-f-1-students/\">Optional Practical Training</a> after their first academic year. OPT is temporary employment that is related to your area of study; the main difference between it and CPT is that OPT can be completed both before or after you graduate, while CPT must be finished before. OPT is also not required to be for an academic objective, unlike CPT.</p>\r\n<p>You will need approval from your DSO in order to do either type of OPT. Pre-completion OPT (done during school) allows for up to 20 hours of work per week; post-completion OPT (done after graduating) allows for both full-time and part-time hours.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Beyond CPT And OPT</strong></h2>\r\n<p>After CPT and OPT expire, F-1 students have a few options. Some seek to continue working in the US by gaining employer sponsorship, while others may register for the F-1 to green card lottery. Once a student&rsquo;s OPT expires, they have a 60-day grace period to transfer their F-1 record to a new school or program, change their visa status, or leave the United States.</p>', 1, 'approved', 0, 'job, work, employer, visa', '2023-03-22 15:34:41', '2023-03-22 15:34:41'),

Figuring out how to get a U.S. student visa when applying for college as an international student can be confusing. This blog covers everything you need to know about applying for a student visa and how to ensure your best chances of visa approval.</p>\r\n<h2>What Is A Student Visa?</h2>\r\n<p>A student visa is a temporary visa that allows foreign nationals to live and study in the U.S. at an accredited higher education institution. Temporary visas are not intended to allow permanent<br>immigration to the U.S. International students who wish to remain in the U.S. after graduation will have to obtain another visa such as an H-1B work visa or a green card.</p>\r\n<p>There are three types of student visas U.S.-bound foreign nationals can apply for. The type of program and school you are applying for determines which student visa you will need.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>F-1 visa: This is the most common type of student visa. The F-1 visa is for undergraduate and graduate-level international students studying full-time at an accredited U.S. college or university or for those studying English at an English language institute.</li>\r\n<li>J-1 visa: This visa is for international students participating in short-term study programs such as an exchange program or study abroad program for one semester in the U.S. J-1 visas can also be for full-time students who are funded by their home country government.</li>\r\n<li>M-1 visa: This less common option is for vocational or other non-academic studies in the U.S. The M-1 mainly applies to career-focused training programs such as culinary school or a vocational program.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>What Are Student Visa Requirements For The U.S.?</h2>\r\n<p>The specific requirements for a U.S. student visa vary depending on the visa and your home country, but here are the general requirements:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Be enrolled in a qualifying academic, language, or training program</li>\r\n<li>Show English language proficiency (unless you are enrolling in an English language program)</li>\r\n<li>Prove that you or your family have the financial means to support you during your time in the U.S.</li>\r\n<li>Remain enrolled full-time throughout the length of the program</li>\r\n<li>Demonstrate that you intend to depart the US after your studies conclude</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>For an F-1 and M-1 visa, the school you are attending must have a Student and Exchange Visitors Program (SEVP) certification from the Department of Homeland Security. You must also continue to have a residence abroad. This proves that you intend to return home after your temporary visa expires.</p>\r\n<p>For a J-1 visa, you will need to have medical insurance throughout your time in the U.S. Contact your host program for more information about the minimum insurance requirements. Lastly, some J-1 visa students may have to return to their home country and live there for at least two years after graduation before they can return to the US on certain temporary visas or on a green card. Fortunately, there are several ways to <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.interstride.com/blog/understanding-j-1-waivers-key-concepts-and-principles/__;!!BiVviWLMkw!VjttUbvDkSLFRT5eRPDl6vOeKVfLRZSvbro9gN6E8ynprgJupadwAMdyEBF-UM76KLw1vuPKaw60AqFf4Q$\">waive this home country physical presence requirement</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>What Does A Student Visa Allow You To Do?</h2>\r\n<p>A student visa allows living and studying in the U.S. full-time for a designated amount of time. Depending on what country you&rsquo;re from, you may have to renew your student visa each year that you are in school. To retain legal status as a temporary student, you must enroll full-time each semester and maintain a GPA of at least 2.0 for undergraduates and 3.0 for graduate students.</p>\r\n<p>Regardless of what type of student visa you are on, you can travel freely around the U.S. when you are not in class. You can also travel back to your home country for summer breaks and holidays but must first obtain travel authorization from your F/M/J student advisor.</p>\r\n<h3>Studying and Working on an F-1 Visa</h3>\r\n<p>Generally, F-1 students are expected to take in-person classes, but they are permitted to take one online class each semester as part of their full-time course load.</p>\r\n<p>While the primary intent of a student visa is to study, part-time work may also be available. The work options for F-1 students include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>On-campus employment up to 20 hours per week</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.interstride.com/blog/optional-practical-training-opt-for-f-1-students/__;!!BiVviWLMkw!VjttUbvDkSLFRT5eRPDl6vOeKVfLRZSvbro9gN6E8ynprgJupadwAMdyEBF-UM76KLw1vuPKaw77GnahDw$\">Optional Practical Training (OPT)</a> &ndash; up to 12 months of work related to the field of study</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/optional-practical-training-extension-for-stem-students-stem-opt__;!!BiVviWLMkw!VjttUbvDkSLFRT5eRPDl6vOeKVfLRZSvbro9gN6E8ynprgJupadwAMdyEBF-UM76KLw1vuPKaw6-u5aOBw$\">STEM Optional Practical Training (STEM OPT)</a> &ndash; up to 24 more months of STEM work after OPT expires</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/studyinthestates.dhs.gov/sevis-help-hub/student-records/fm-student-employment/f-1-curricular-practical-training-cpt__;!!BiVviWLMkw!VjttUbvDkSLFRT5eRPDl6vOeKVfLRZSvbro9gN6E8ynprgJupadwAMdyEBF-UM76KLw1vuPKaw6zldNiDA$\">Curricular Practical Training (CPT)</a> &ndash; practical training (like a co-op) required by the degree program</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>OPT can be used before or after graduation as long as you do not exceed the time limits listed above. For example, if you use six months of OPT while you are still in school, then you will only have six months of OPT work authorization to use after graduation. This means you may have to leave the U.S. sooner if you cannot acquire another visa. CPT authorization is determined by your school and more specifically, your program. Do note that if you work full-time for 12 months under CPT, you will not be eligible for OPT.</p>\r\n<h3>Studying and Working on a J-1 Visa</h3>\r\n<p>J-1 students must maintain a full-time course load of in-person classes each semester. They can only take online classes in addition to the full course load and only with prior approval. J-1 students are also permitted to work part-time on-campus while studying, as long as they obtain the necessary work authorization. While J-1 students aren&rsquo;t eligible for OPT or CPT programs, they may obtain &ldquo;Academic Training&rdquo; where they can work in a position related to their field of study for up to 18 months (or the period of the degree program, whichever is shorter) during or after their academic program (STEM students and Ph.D.&rsquo;s can sometimes be authorized for more than 18 months).</p>\r\n<h3>Can I Bring My Spouse and Children With Me to the U.S.?</h3>\r\n<p>No matter which type of student visa you have, you can bring your spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21 with you to the U.S. However, what they are allowed to do in the U.S. depends on which visa you are on. For a J-1 visa holder, spouses can apply for work authorization and/or study in the U.S. full-time as long as you and they maintain legal visa status. They will each receive a J-2 visa.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, spouses and dependents of an F-1 or M-1 visa holder cannot legally work in the U.S. They can only study part-time at an accredited university (for F-2 visas) or a vocational school (for M-2 visas). If your spouse wants to work or study full-time, they will have to apply for a separate visa.</p>\r\n<h2>How To Apply For A U.S. Student Visa</h2>\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s an overview of the steps of applying for a student visa in the U.S.:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Apply and enroll at a SEVP-approved school.</li>\r\n<li>Register for the <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study/student-visa.html*ExternalPopup__;Iw!!BiVviWLMkw!VjttUbvDkSLFRT5eRPDl6vOeKVfLRZSvbro9gN6E8ynprgJupadwAMdyEBF-UM76KLw1vuPKaw4lgwATiQ$\">Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)</a> and pay the I-901 fee.</li>\r\n<li>Review form I-20 (for F-1 and M-1 visas) or form DS-2019 (for J-1 visas)to ensure all information is accurate. Your university will provide this form.</li>\r\n<li>Complete the online visa application (form DS-160) and pay the application fee.</li>\r\n<li>Gather all necessary documents including your passport, application confirmation page, and application fee payment receipt.</li>\r\n<li>Complete a visa interview with a consular officer at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in your home country.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The DS-2019 or I-20 document will be provided by your school after you enroll. After you receive the form, you can pay the SEVIS fee and complete your online visa application. You will need to submit a <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/photos.html__;!!BiVviWLMkw!VjttUbvDkSLFRT5eRPDl6vOeKVfLRZSvbro9gN6E8ynprgJupadwAMdyEBF-UM76KLw1vuPKaw7uQch13Q$\">qualifying photo of yourself</a> with the application. Make sure to print the confirmation page to bring to your visa interview.</p>\r\n<p>There may be a wait time for visa interviews depending on the location, time of year, and type of visa. To ensure your visa is approved before your first semester begins, schedule your visa interview appointment as early as possible. However, F-1 and M-1 visas can only be issued up to 120 days before the start date of the academic program.</p>\r\n<p>While you are waiting for your scheduled interview, make sure you have collected all required documents. Additional documents that may be requested include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Birth certificate</li>\r\n<li>High school transcripts</li>\r\n<li>University acceptance letter</li>\r\n<li>Standardized test scores</li>\r\n<li>Financial documentation showing how you will pay for educational, living, and travel costs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>During your interview, the officer will ask questions about your academic program, how you plan to financially support yourself during the program, and your intentions after graduation. They will also do a digital fingerprint scan and review your required documents. The entire interview will likely only last a couple of minutes. Lastly, pay any remaining fees, and you&rsquo;re ready to travel to the U.S.!</p>\r\n<h2>Common Mistakes That Lead To Student Visa Denial</h2>\r\n<p>Getting accepted into an approved U.S. university does not mean your student visa request will automatically be approved. There are many reasons why student visas are rejected. For example, your visa may be rejected if you do not intend to attend school full-time. For undergraduate students in the U.S., full-time means at least 12 credits per semester. For graduate students, you only need nine credits per semester to be considered full-time.</p>\r\n<p>Here are some common mistakes that cause student visa rejection:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Having incomplete or accurately completed forms</li>\r\n<li>Not having enough money to support yourself for at least one academic year</li>\r\n<li>Passport expiring less than six months before the end of your academic program</li>\r\n<li>Implying that you plan to stay in the U.S. after graduation</li>\r\n<li>Being late to the visa interview</li>\r\n<li>Forgetting to bring necessary documents to the interview such as receipts of fees paid</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>What Do I Do If My Student Visa is Rejected?</h3>\r\n<p>If your student visa is rejected, you will need to reapply. However, make sure you understand why your first application was rejected before reapplying. Ask the official who interviewed you to give you a written explanation for the visa denial. Understanding the reason(s) for the denial will help you correct any mistakes and increase your chances of approval the second time. You should discuss the denial with your school and possibly, with a US immigration attorney, prior to re-applying.</p>\r\n<p>If you think there is a possibility that your visa will not be approved in time, notify the admissions office and ask for an extension. They are often willing to be flexible if you communicate in advance.</p>\r\n<h2>Set Yourself Up For Success As An International Student</h2>\r\n<p>Getting a U.S. student visa requires acceptance to an approved university or academic program and an interview with a government official. It&rsquo;s important to begin preparing early by completing all the necessary forms and collecting other pertinent documents needed to gain visa approval. Procrastinating could cause your visa application to be denied. Once you understand how to get a student visa, it becomes easier to navigate the process and ensure that your visa will be approved and you will be able to smoothly enter the U.S.</p>', 1, 'approved', 0, NULL, '2023-03-22 15:36:56', '2023-03-22 15:36:56'),

International students can explore their options for a maximum of two years before having to declare a major. When choosing where and what major to study as an international student, you should be thoughtful in making these decisions to ensure your studies fit your long-term goals and career aspirations.</p>\r\n<h2>Should You Pursue A B.A. Or B.S. Degree?</h2>\r\n<p>A bachelor&rsquo;s degree is the most common undergraduate degree students receive at colleges and universities in the United States. It is the first level of higher education and takes most students four years to complete. The two types of bachelor&rsquo;s degrees are a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and a Bachelor of Science (B.S.).</p>\r\n<p>A BA degree focuses generally on humanities and liberal arts, and includes courses in areas such as literature, history, philosophy, and the social sciences. A BS degree, also stylized as a BSc, typically focuses on math, science, and technological majors. When choosing a major, you will most often be choosing between a BA and a BS degree.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Read about the differences between a B.A. and B.S. Degree </strong><a href=\"https://www.interstride.com/blog/what-is-a-ba-vs-bs-degree/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Some students choose to pursue an advanced graduate or postdoctoral degree, such as a Master&rsquo;s degree or PhD. Oftentimes, choosing a major has a large impact on your choice of advanced degree. But that&rsquo;s not always the case. While a major in biology might translate best into medical school, or a major in political science might translate best into law school, a choice of major does not always have to directly tie to your advanced degree. Many MBA programs have accepted students who majored in humanities, social sciences, and the arts, just as many MEd programs have accepted students who have majored in mathematics, business, etc.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>What Are Majors, Double Majors, And Minors?</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Choosing a major, or what to study, as an international student is a big decision in college. However, choosing a major is a decision that does not need to be made right away. That being said, studying in the U.S. is a big financial decision for international students as well. You&rsquo;ll want your choice of major, and therefore degree, to not only support your personal and professional goals, but also provide a return on your investment of money and time.</p>\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2018/2018434.pdf\">U.S. Department of Education</a>, nearly a third of college students change their major in the first few years of college. Your choice of major determines what classes you will take and the skills you will gain during your four years. Many colleges and universities offer flexibility in deciding your major, and will often allow up to two years to decide and declare your major. Take your time in determining which major is best for you!</p>\r\n<p><strong>DOUBLE MAJORS</strong></p>\r\n<p>Some students have a hard time choosing just one field of study and have the option to double major (study two majors at the same time), or select a minor (secondary area of study) in addition to their primary major. Double majoring in the United States is common practice and allows students to graduate with one degree in two areas. When a student declares two majors, the two majors often go hand in hand, and may be offered by the same department. For example, a double major in International Studies and Foreign Policy or Finance and Marketing are common pairings.</p>\r\n<p><strong>MINORS</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you choose to select a major and a minor, the major will be your principal area of study. The minor is a secondary, supplemental area of study. Majors and minors can be in similar or different areas. This allows students to focus their studies on a major that fits their intended career, while studying additional courses of interest to them. For example, a Business major and Philosophy minor, or a Finance major and Photography pairing.</p>\r\n<p>As an international student, double majoring or declaring a major and minor, can show future employers that you have a more robust knowledge base. However, do not choose to double major or minor just for the sake of it. Be thoughtful in your decision and consider how choosing an additional major or minor will support your interests and goals.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>What Should You Consider When Choosing A Major?</strong></h2>\r\n<p>When considering a major, especially as an international student, you should ask yourself &ldquo;what major is best for me?&rdquo; Not only should your major be in an area you&rsquo;re passionate about, but it&rsquo;s important to remember that the major you choose can impact your career path post-graduation. As an international student, your choice of major can impact your ability to work in the United States after graduation if that is your goal.</p>\r\n<p>When considering your field of study, there are some important questions you should ask yourself, within two key areas:</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Desired Career Outcomes</strong> &ndash; Think about the impact and value this major will have on your career path.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>What career path do I want after college?</li>\r\n<li>Will this major help me achieve the career I want?</li>\r\n<li>What are my professional goals?</li>\r\n<li>What is the average salary for jobs in this industry?</li>\r\n<li>Are there a lot of job opportunities in this industry?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>2. Immigration Benefits</strong> &ndash; Think about the implications of your degree on your ability to stay and work in the U.S. For example, STEM majors are a great option as these degrees offer advantages for international students after graduation.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Are jobs in this industry difficult to get in the U.S.?</li>\r\n<li>Will this major lead to an advanced degree?</li>\r\n<li>Is this major STEM OPT eligible?</li>\r\n<li>Wil this major make it difficult to find a job in my home country?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><strong>Which Majors Do International Students Choose?</strong></h2>\r\n<p>The<a href=\"https://opendoorsdata.org/data/international-students/fields-of-study/\"> top three majors</a> among international students in the United States are (1) Math and Computer Science, (2) Engineering, and (3) Business and Management. As an international student, choosing a major in one of these areas, such as computer science, may position you at an advantage when searching for jobs or internships in the future. Degrees in these areas often generate high paying jobs and offer extensive opportunities for career growth. For example, students who major in computer science may see more job opportunities and higher chances of receiving jobs soon after graduation. Additionally, careers in computer science are safe and are unlikely to be impacted by shifts in the economy. Based on USCIS&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studies/H-1B/h-1B-FY16.pdf\">H-1B statistics</a>, computer-related careers are the most in-demand foreign labor category. Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2017/article/projections-overview-and-highlights-2016-26.htm\">according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics</a>, jobs in computer and information systems, finance, and software are projected to be some of the highest paying jobs of the future. See below for some sample majors and their career tracks.</p>\r\n<p>As an international student, when you graduate with a degree in a STEM major,&nbsp; you can receive a 12-month OPT to 24-month OPT extension after graduation. The 36-month window is the perfect time for you as an international student to apply for an internship or gain relevant work experience.

To start, it&rsquo;s important to think through what you want to get out of your degree. The benefit of studying in the United States is the flexibility offered in choosing your major or field of study. Don&rsquo;t feel pressured to know right away! Thoughtfully consider the majors that will guarantee you a job you want, expand your knowledge in areas you&rsquo;re passionate about, and help you secure a path in the U.S. after graduating.</p>', 1, 'approved', 0, NULL, '2023-03-22 15:44:20', '2023-03-22 15:44:20');

It is the first level of higher education and is a prerequisite for graduate programs, such as a master&rsquo;s or doctoral degree program. You can choose to get either a Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts degree. Whether you decide to get a BA vs. BS, a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in the U.S. will require you to choose a major in a specific subject area, such as business, finance, chemistry or engineering.</p>\r\n<h2>How Is A Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree In The U.S. Different From Degrees In Other Countries?</h2>\r\n<p>A bachelor&rsquo;s degree in the U.S. may be different from a bachelor&rsquo;s program in your home country. Key differences include length of time to complete, cost, majors available, and types of programs. The U.S. offers a wider array of higher education institutes at all levels and the types of degrees available. Here are 3 reasons why you should consider higher education in the U.S.:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>More flexibility and freedom </strong>&ndash; Unlike other countries, you can enroll in a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree program without having to declare a major right away. In Europe, universities require students to apply to and begin a specific degree program immediately, often with little room for adjustment. In the U.S., students typically have two years before they must choose a major. This is a great opportunity for you to take a variety of courses to help you decide on a specialized track and on whether to pursue a Bachelor of Arts vs Bachelor of Science degree.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option to specialize in multiple areas of study</strong> &ndash; In the U.S., you can choose to study a single major, add a minor (secondary area of specialization), or even pursue a double major (studying two majors at the same time). Minoring or double majoring allows you to build a larger knowledge base and can ultimately help you access more career opportunities in the future.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Opportunity to work after graduation &ndash; </strong>As an international student, you are eligible to work in the U.S. after graduation through the <a href=\"https://www.interstride.com/blog/optional-practical-training-opt-vs-stem-opt/\">Optional Practical Training (OPT)</a> program. OPT allows you to work full-time for a maximum of 12 months so you can gain professional experience without having to apply for an H-1B visa. In general, you must work a job that is directly related to your area of study. If you study a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in the STEM field, you can apply for an additional 24 month extension. This means you can work for up to 3 years after graduation without a visa.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Bachelor Of Arts (B.A.)</h2>\r\n<p>A B.A. degree is less specialized than a B.S. degree. In contrast to a B.S. degree, which focuses more on technical and scientific subjects, the B.A. degree focuses on humanities and liberal arts, and generally offers students a broad-based education. Upon graduation, students who have earned a B.A. degree are typically well-prepared for a wide range of careers and graduate programs.</p>\r\n<h2>Bachelor Of Science (B.S.)</h2>\r\n<p>A B.S. degree provides a more in-depth and specialized education in a particular field of study than a B.A. degree. B.S. degrees typically focus on math, science, and technological majors, and usually involve more major-specific courses and fewer opportunities for students to pursue classes outside of their field of study. After graduation, students with a BS degree will be thoroughly trained in their field of study, and will be well equipped to apply for graduate programs or pursue specialized roles in the relevant industry.</p>\r\n<h2>What Is The Difference Between A B.A. And B.S. Degree?</h2>\r\n<p>A B.A. degree places a larger emphasis on social sciences, humanities, and liberal arts, while a B.S. degree prioritizes science, reasoning, logic, analytics, and quantitative skills. However, B.A. and B.S. degrees are not that different when it comes to program structure. Both require you to choose a specific major or area of study, and can be completed in the standard four years.</p>\r\n<p>Some majors can even be completed as either a B.A. or B.S. degree. Common programs offered as both a B.A. and B.S. include computer science, engineering, mathematics, biology, business, psychology, and economics. If you decide to pursue a B.S. over a B.A. in one of these fields, your degree will require a full course load of relevant topics. Alternatively, if you pursue a B.A., you will have the flexibility to explore elective classes in other disciplines, such as philosophy, creative arts, sociology, or history, in addition to your primary focus of study.</p>\r\n<h2>Is A B.A. Or B.S. Degree Better?</h2>\r\n<p>While neither a B.A. or B.S. degree is better than the other, choosing the right type of bachelor&rsquo;s degree will depend on your interests, goals, and future career aspirations.</p>\r\n<p>There are many benefits for getting a B.A. degree as an international student. Pursuing a B.A. exposes you to a wide variety of courses and the opportunity to practice and master a range of beneficial skills, including communication, writing, leadership, critical thinking, and problem solving. Developing these &lsquo;soft skills&rsquo; are becoming increasingly more valuable to companies. A B.A. degree can be a great option to stand out to employers as an international student while demonstrating a widespread area of expertise.</p>\r\n<p>If your goal is to stay and work in the U.S. long term, a B.S. degree may be a better option. Since B.S. degrees require you to study your major in depth, having a specialized knowledge base can better position you for the workforce after graduation. Because a B.S. typically focuses on math, science, and technology, students are often required to pursue &lsquo;real life experience,&rsquo; such as internships, lab work, and field studies, in order to successfully complete their degree. This allows you to build practical experience as an international student, and can open you up to more job opportunities and potential visa sponsorship. If you wish to pursue an advanced degree like a Master&rsquo;s or doctorate, a B.S. is also preferred.</p>\r\n<h2>Which Degree Should You Choose: B.A. Or B.S.?</h2>\r\n<p>Overall, when making the decision between a Bachelor of Arts vs a Bachelor of Science degree, you should consider your long-term goals and career plans. Think about subject areas, questions, or passions that excite you, and start there. As an international student, your decision can shape your path in the U.S. Consider examining job boards and LinkedIn profiles of current employees to help you determine a degree program that best fits your intended career.</p>\r\n<p>Remember, if you&rsquo;re unsure what type of degree to choose, that&rsquo;s ok! College is the time to figure that out and explore. Remember, students typically have until the end of their second year to declare a program of study. To help you determine whether a B.A. vs B.S. is more suitable for you, reach out to your university&rsquo;s career services office or contact college counselors and professors for more guidance.</p>\r\n<h2>Do Employers Prefer A B.A. Or B.S. Degree?</h2>\r\n<p>While some positions require certain degrees, most employers have little preference on the type of degree and instead look at your highest degree level earned, relevant coursework, performance indicators, and extracurricular activities.</p>\r\n<p>As an international student, it&rsquo;s a good idea to <a href=\"https://www.interstride.com/blog/why-international-students-should-consider-stem-majors/\"> consider pursuing degrees in STEM</a> (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math), and therefore a B.S. degree. The U.S. wants to attract foreign talent to maintain its global leadership in technology and science, and is more likely to grant work visa authorization for STEM professionals. Due to increased demand, employers are also willing to pay higher wages and provide visa sponsorship. If you are interested in legally living and working in the U.S. after graduation, pursuing a B.S. degree in the STEM field may be the best option for you.</p>\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p>Ultimately, the decision to get a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Science is entirely up to you. One is not better than the other, and there is no &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; option. A B.S. degree will provide you with a more holistic education, whereas a B.S. degree will involve a more rigid and technical education. In considering which degree to choose as an international student, base your decision on your interests and goals. Whether you are currently a student or still exploring which school to apply to, remember that you can always reach out to the university for academic advice and career guidance.</p>', 1, 'approved', 0, NULL, '2023-03-22 15:47:04', '2023-03-22 15:47:04'),

However, it is not the easiest option for everyone. International students who are not successful in the H-1B lottery or don&rsquo;t have an employer to sponsor them, such as entrepreneurs, may seek out alternatives to the H-1B visa.</p>\r\n<h2>What Is An H-1B Visa?</h2>\r\n<p>The H-1B is one of the most common employer-sponsored visas in the U.S. Every year, hundreds of thousands of applicants enter a lottery to apply for it. Unfortunately, there are only 65,000 H-1B visas available per year for graduates with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree. If you have a master&rsquo;s or other advanced degree from a U.S. university, you are eligible for an additional 20,000 visas in the lottery. A lottery is held each March to determine who is allotted one of the 85,000 H-1B visas.</p>\r\n<p>One of the benefits of the H-1B is that it is a dual intent visa, which means you can apply for permanent residency while on this visa. The H-1B visa lasts up to six years with the possibility for further extensions in limited circumstances.</p>\r\n<h3>H-1B Cap Exemptions</h3>\r\n<p>The following types of U.S. employers are exempt from the H-1B lottery and associated quota:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Public and private non-profit colleges and universities</li>\r\n<li>Non-profit research organizations</li>\r\n<li>Government research organizations</li>\r\n<li>Non-Profit entities affiliated with a qualifying college/university</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Instead of applying for an H-1B visa by entering the lottery, the employer submits a petition to USCIS directly and the case is reviewed on its merit. This increases your likelihood of being granted an H-1B visa. You can apply any time of year rather than waiting until March for the lottery.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.interstride.com/students/__;!!BiVviWLMkw!Q7KIyyESDw8sxMdpHfSQPjNPipey4qlbOTmAPor3DkOtFsXa3qGJI9lTVOlvH5xC8hORvoN2PYkcEwbThg$\"><em>Interstride&rsquo;s student portal</em></a><em> lets you search specifically for H-1B cap-exempt jobs. Talk to your university about partnering with Interstride for access.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h2>What Are The Alternatives To H-1B</h2>\r\n<p>With the high demand for H-1B and a difficult lottery system, it&rsquo;s easy to see why international students and recent graduates are looking for H-1B alternatives. If you are not able to find a cap-exempt job, there are other H-1B alternatives, whether you are seeking a temporary visa or permanent residence in the U.S.</p>\r\n<h3>Work Authorization for Student Visas</h3>\r\n<p>For international students on an F-1 visa, the <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.interstride.com/blog/optional-practical-training-opt-for-f-1-students/__;!!BiVviWLMkw!Q7KIyyESDw8sxMdpHfSQPjNPipey4qlbOTmAPor3DkOtFsXa3qGJI9lTVOlvH5xC8hORvoN2PYnoIwPbsw$\">Optional Practical Training</a> (OPT) program allows you to work in the U.S. for up to one year after graduation or for up to three years for <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/stemList2022.pdf__;!!BiVviWLMkw!XiWbuWK6XatvtkeM1eWwf4teiwXL2aNDulsBsuDYp_JxYyL5JmKoe-JYyQ2-KmW2xccICf7jh-66YErnNw$\">certain STEM majors</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Here are some key things to know about OPT:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The job must be relevant to your field of study.</li>\r\n<li>You can use OPT before and after graduation but only for the total time allowed.</li>\r\n<li>If you re-enroll in school as a graduate student (after completing your bachelor&rsquo;s), your allotted OPT time restarts. You can have 1 period of authorized OPT per subsequent academic level (ie OPT for Associates degree and then again for Bachelor&rsquo;s and then Masters, etc.)</li>\r\n<li>OPT and STEM OPT have a 60-day grace period before you must leave the country.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>International students studying STEM on a J-1 visa have a work authorization option through the Academic Training (AT) program. AT typically only lasts 18 months, but <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.state.gov/new-initiatives-further-opportunity-for-international-stem-students-scholars-and-researchers-u-s-entities/__;!!BiVviWLMkw!Q7KIyyESDw8sxMdpHfSQPjNPipey4qlbOTmAPor3DkOtFsXa3qGJI9lTVOlvH5xC8hORvoN2PYnFLizuDA$\">the Biden administration has expanded the program</a> to offer a total of 36 months of work authorization for undergraduate and graduate students in STEM fields (as long as the AT does not exceed the length of the degree program). Like OPT, AT jobs must be directly related to the student&rsquo;s field of study. The grace period after AT ends is 30 days.</p>\r\n<h3>Temporary Work Visas for Foreign Nationals From Specific Countries</h3>\r\n<p>There are three different work visas for foreign nationals from specific countries. These visas have varying requirements, but they are all temporary visas that do not allow for dual intent. That means it can be challenging to apply for a green card on any of these visas.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>E-3 for Australian citizens</li>\r\n<li>H-1B1 for Chilean and Singaporean citizens</li>\r\n<li>TN for Mexican and Canadian citizens</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There are 10,500 E-3 visas for Australian citizens available per year. They require employer sponsorship in a specialty occupation which requires at least a bachelor&rsquo;s degree. A specialty occupation is defined as any occupation that applies highly specialized knowledge, so STEM jobs normally qualify. An E-3 visa lasts two years with indefinite extensions possible.</p>\r\n<p>The H-1B1 visa for Chilean and Singaporean has the same requirements as the E-3 visa. However, it only lasts one year before renewal is needed. There are only 1,400 H-1B1 visas for Chilean citizens and 5,400 for Singaporean citizens each year.</p>\r\n<p>The TN visa for Mexican and Canadian citizens requires employer sponsorship, and only <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/legalpad.io/blog/what-is-the-tn-and-who-qualifies/__;!!BiVviWLMkw!Q7KIyyESDw8sxMdpHfSQPjNPipey4qlbOTmAPor3DkOtFsXa3qGJI9lTVOlvH5xC8hORvoN2PYlSQXVJVA$\">specific occupations</a> qualify for this visa. There is no limit on the number of TN visas offered each year. The visa lasts three years with the option to renew indefinitely. Canadians may apply for a TN Visa at the border while Mexicans must apply at a consulate abroad.</p>\r\n<h3>L-1 Intracompany Transfer</h3>\r\n<p>The L-1 visa is for intracompany transferees. To qualify, you must work for one year in another country as an executive, manager or someone who possesses specialized knowledge. Then, you can transfer from that country to the U.S. with an affiliated company such as a parent company, subsidiary, or branch. STEM graduates who are considering this option should look for employment at companies that have locations in the U.S. and in other countries that have less strict immigration laws (or your home country).</p>\r\n<p>There are two types of L-1 visas. L-1A is for executives and managers. This visa can last up to seven years, but recent graduates may not qualify for these positions due to a lack of managerial experience. The L-1B is typically a better option for international students who recently graduated because it is for workers with specialized knowledge at their job. This visa can last up to five years with extensions.</p>\r\n<p>Both L-1A and L-1B are dual intent visas, so you can begin the process of applying for permanent residency while working in the U.S. on an L-1 visa. Another benefit of L-1 visas is that the spouses of visa holders are also authorized to work in the U.S.</p>\r\n<h3>O-1 for Persons With Extraordinary Ability</h3>\r\n<p>The O-1 employer-sponsored visa may be a good option for STEM graduates with extraordinary ability in one of the following areas:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Science</li>\r\n<li>Arts</li>\r\n<li>Education</li>\r\n<li>Business</li>\r\n<li>Athletics</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To qualify, applicants must demonstrate exceptional ability by providing evidence for at least <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-2-part-m-chapter-4*3*1__;IyM!!BiVviWLMkw!Q7KIyyESDw8sxMdpHfSQPjNPipey4qlbOTmAPor3DkOtFsXa3qGJI9lTVOlvH5xC8hORvoN2PYmLsbsvpw$\">three out of eight criteria</a>. It is never too early to start working on meeting these criteria even if you are still in college. The O-1 visa is appealing for many recent graduates because it can be extended an unlimited number of times, and you can apply for permanent residency while on an O-1.</p>\r\n<h3>Self-Sponsored Permanent Residency Options</h3>\r\n<p>For STEM graduates seeking permanent residency, it is possible to apply for a green card without H-1B status. If you are an international student on an F-1 visa, you can actually begin applying for your green card before you graduate, but it can be complicated and usually is recommended to work with an attorney. There are two types of green cards that are relevant to STEM professionals and do not require employer sponsorship: EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW) and EB-1A Extraordinary Ability.</p>\r\n<p><strong>EB-2 NIW&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>The EB-2 NIW is for those whose impact will benefit the U.S. Because you can self-sponsor, this is a good option for STEM entrepreneurs as well as for researchers/scientists. The work you plan to do must have substantial merit and national importance, and you must prove that you are well-qualified for the role.

Navigating all the work visa and permanent residency options can be overwhelming. Let&rsquo;s break down your options in detail for both undergraduate and graduate-level study.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Working During And After Graduation As An International Student</h2>\r\n<p>International students should begin thinking about their post-graduation work options in advance to set themselves up for success when navigating the complex U.S. immigration system.</p>\r\n<p>International students on an F-1 visa can legally work in the U.S. for up to one year after graduation through the <a href=\"https://www.interstride.com/blog/optional-practical-training-opt-for-f-1-students/\">Optional Practical Training</a> (OPT) program, while <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/stemList2022.pdf__;!!BiVviWLMkw!XiWbuWK6XatvtkeM1eWwf4teiwXL2aNDulsBsuDYp_JxYyL5JmKoe-JYyQ2-KmW2xccICf7jh-66YErnNw$\">certain STEM majors</a> can extend OPT for up to two more years. OPT allows undergraduate and graduate international students to start working right after graduation or while they are still finishing their degrees. In some cases, <a href=\"https://www.interstride.com/blog/launching-a-startup-during-school-or-after-graduation-here-are-6-u-s-work-visa-options-for-student-founders/\">OPT can also be used by a student entrepreneur</a> to start their company before or after graduation.</p>\r\n<p>Once OPT or STEM OPT expires, international students only have 60 days to leave the U.S. or find alternative work authorization. Therefore, the sooner you start exploring work visa options, the better. If you wait until college graduation to begin the process, you will likely have to leave the U.S. at the end of the 60-day grace period. Use this guide to learn more about U.S. work visa options for international students.</p>\r\n<h2>U.S. Work Visa Options For International Students After Graduation</h2>\r\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t qualify for OPT or want to stay in the U.S. after your OPT expires, you will need a U.S. work visa. The four most common temporary work visas are the H-1B, E-2, TN, and O-1A. For international students seeking permanent residency, the two best employment-based green card options are EB-2 NIW and EB-1A. Each visa and green card has different qualifications, application requirements, and processing times.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>H-1B Visa</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The H-1B visa is the most popular temporary work visa. The U.S. uses a lottery system for H-1B visa selection. Here&rsquo;s what you should know about the H-1B lottery:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>65,000 visas are given to those with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree.</li>\r\n<li>An additional 20,000 visas are given to those with a master&rsquo;s degree or higher.</li>\r\n<li>Your employer must apply for the lottery in March.</li>\r\n<li>You can begin working on an H-1B in October of the same year.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If your student visa or OPT grace period is set to expire before October, the employer can also apply for an H-1B Cap Gap Extension so that you can remain in the U.S. until the H-1B becomes effective. The H-1B visa lasts six years with the possibility to extend and apply for permanent residency.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>E-2 Visa</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The E-2 visa may be a good option for student entrepreneurs. To qualify, you must be from a <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/fees/treaty.html\">treaty country</a> and invest a significant amount of seed money into your company. The amount that counts as significant depends on the value of the company. You must also own at least 50% of the company.</p>\r\n<p>There is no degree requirement for an E-2 visa which means that a qualifying student entrepreneur could apply before they graduate. This visa can be extended indefinitely as long as the business is operational and viable.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>TN Visa</strong></h3>\r\n<p>A TN visa can work well for international students from Canada or Mexico. Only <a href=\"https://legalpad.io/blog/what-is-the-tn-and-who-qualifies/\">specific occupations</a> qualify for this visa, some of which include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Nursing and other medical professions</li>\r\n<li>Teaching higher education</li>\r\n<li>Engineering</li>\r\n<li>Accounting</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>While you must have at least a bachelor&rsquo;s degree to apply, there is no limit on the number of visas offered each year. A TN visa lasts three years with the option to renew indefinitely. However, unlike the H-1B and E-2, a TN visa is not for dual intent. That means it&rsquo;s more complex and challenging to apply for permanent residency while on a TN visa.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>O-1A Visa</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The O-1A is a temporary work visa for individuals with extraordinary abilities. It&rsquo;s one of the best options for student entrepreneurs because there is no specific degree or income requirements. Other international students may qualify for this visa if they have demonstrated extraordinary abilities in one of the following areas:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Science</li>\r\n<li>Arts</li>\r\n<li>Education</li>\r\n<li>Business</li>\r\n<li>Athletics</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To prove extraordinary ability for an O-1A visa, you must meet <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-2-part-m-chapter-4#3#1\">three out of eight criteria</a>. You can begin working to meet some of these criteria while still in college. The visa is valid for three years and can be extended indefinitely. You can also apply for permanent residency while on an O-1A visa.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>EB-2 NIW&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW) is a permanent immigrant petition. You will need to have either an advanced degree or <a href=\"https://legalpad.io/blog/eb-2-exceptional-ability-criteria-explained/\">exceptional ability</a>to qualify. If you are applying as a student entrepreneur, you must prove that your company has strong potential to be successful and make a positive impact in the U.S. in the future. Examples include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Economic impact: creating more jobs</li>\r\n<li>Social impact: providing a public service</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Once your EB-2 NIW is approved, you will have to wait until your green card is processed before you can use it to legally work in the U.S. This can take up to a year, so consider applying at least 12 months before graduation or before your OPT expires. EB-2 NIW processing times are especially high for students from China and India.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>EB-1A&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n<p>EB-1A is one of the most difficult U.S. green card pathways because you must prove that you are in the top 1% of your field. You will be judged based on <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-first-preference-eb-1\">three out of ten criteria</a>. If you are thinking about an EB-1A green card, start preparing while you are still in school. The time it takes to get a green card through the EB-1A tends to be shorter than the process with the EB-2 NIW. However, you should still plan to apply for the EB-1A at least a year before your OPT expires.</p>\r\n<p>International students from China and India may be particularly interested in an EB-1A because it offers shorter wait times for individuals from these countries than other permanent residency options.</p>\r\n<h2>Timeline And Tips For Setting Yourself Up For Success</h2>\r\n<p>The benefit of researching and preparing for work visas before you graduate is that you can leverage your time in college to <a href=\"https://legalpad.io/blog/what-you-can-do-now-if-you-arent-qualified-for-the-o-1-visa-yet/\">meet the qualifications for competitive visas like the O-1 </a>and EB-1A. Here are some tips for setting yourself up for success as an international student:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Try to get featured in the press during school</li>\r\n<li>Compete in relevant industry competitions</li>\r\n<li>Join a reputable professional organization relevant to your field of study</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Some visa options may be a better fit for undergraduate students while others may be suited for graduate students. <a href=\"https://legalpad.io/partner/interstride/\">Legalpad</a> can help you decide whether to apply for a <a href=\"https://legalpad.io/blog/o-1-vs-eb-2-niw-for-startup-founders-and-international-students/\">temporary visa such as an O-1 versus a permanent residency petition such as the EB-2 NIW</a>. For example, if you plan to graduate or finish OPT within the next year, consider applying for an O-1 since it usually has faster processing times than a green card.</p>\r\n<h2>Finding The Right Immigration Path After Graduation</h2>\r\n<p>Choosing the best immigration path starts with your specific immigration goals. Do you want to stay in the U.S. temporarily after graduation to work for a few years and then go back home or relocate to a different country? Or, is your ultimate goal to establish permanent residency in the U.S.? Furthermore, if you are an entrepreneur, your immigration path may look different than that of a full-time employee.</p>', 1, 'approved', 0, NULL, '2023-03-22 16:07:45', '2023-03-22 16:07:45'),

Use this guide to help you navigate U.S. visa options so that you can legally remain in the country while growing your business.</p>\r\n<p>There are several steps student founders can take to launch their company in the U.S. prior to obtaining work authorization. This includes setting up your business entity such as an LLC, securing investors and clients, and acquiring a workspace. A startup founder who is still in college only needs work authorization once the business is operational and they are actively working and earning a salary.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Starting A Business While In College Vs After Graduation</strong></h2>\r\n<p>International students on an F-1 visa can use Curricular Practice Training (CPT) or Optional Practical Training (OPT) to start their business in the U.S. Both allow student founders to work in the business for up to one year while they are still in school. It is important to note that OPT can also be used after graduation while CPT cannot.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When starting a business on OPT, you must:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Ensure the business has any legally required licenses&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Engage in work that is related to your degree program</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>For STEM students starting a STEM-related business, OPT can be extended another two years post-graduation. If you are a startup founder on a STEM OPT extension, you must also work full-time for the business and register your company on <a href=\"https://www.e-verify.gov/\">E-verify.gov</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After OPT/STEM OPT expires, students have just 60 days to find alternative work authorizations or they will be forced to leave the country. For international students to continue working in the U.S. at the company they founded, a new work visa is necessary.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>6 U.S. Work Visa Options For Founders</strong></h2>\r\n<p>A startup founder whose OPT or CPT degree program is ending can apply for a temporary (nonimmigrant) visa like an O-1A, H-1B, E-2, or TN. They can also apply for a permanent resident visa, known as a green card, such as the EB-2 NIW or EB-1A. Let&rsquo;s explore each of these options more closely.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>O-1A Visa</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The O-1A work visa is a temporary visa for individuals with extraordinary abilities, and it&rsquo;s one of the best options for startup founders. To qualify for an O-1A visa, you must meet three of these <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-2-part-m-chapter-4#3#1\">eight criteria</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What makes the O-1A so appealing?</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li aria-level=\"1\">It is valid for three years and can be extended indefinitely.</li>\r\n<li aria-level=\"1\">There is no minimum income requirement.</li>\r\n<li aria-level=\"1\">There is no specific degree requirement.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>H-1B Visa</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The H-1B visa is the most common nonimmigrant work visa. It lasts six years with the possibility to extend and apply for permanent residency. However, the H-1B visa has a wage requirement for employees depending on their position.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If you are working as a C-level executive at your company, such as a CEO, CTO, or COO, the high wage requirement may be difficult to meet as an early-stage, student founder. Regardless of the company size or stage, you must pay yourself the prevailing wage required for all C-suite roles &ndash; no exceptions. An H-1B also requires the visa holder to have an employer who can supervise them. For business owners, this supervisory entity could be a co-founder or board of directors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>E-2 Visa</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The E-2 visa is specifically for investors from certain <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/fees/treaty.html\">treaty countries</a>. Business founders qualify if they invested a significant amount of seed money into the company. While the <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/e-2-treaty-investors\">USCIS</a> does not specify how much qualifies as a significant amount, the general guidance is that the investment should be proportional to the business.</p>\r\n<p>Important details to know about the E-2 investor visa:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The investor must own at least 50% of the company.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The visa can be extended indefinitely as long as the business is viable.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>TN Visa</strong></h3>\r\n<p>If you are a startup founder from Canada or Mexico, it&rsquo;s worth looking into the TN visa. To qualify, you must work for your business in a <a href=\"https://legalpad.io/blog/what-is-the-tn-and-who-qualifies/\">specific role</a>. This option includes the possibility to renew the visa indefinitely, and there is no limit on the number of visas offered each year.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>EB-2 NIW&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW) is a permanent immigrant petition. This differs from the other visas discussed so far because it does not give you work authorization. If your STEM OPT expires, getting an approved EB-2 NIW would not immediately help you stay in the U.S.&nbsp; Once your EB-2 NIW is approved, you will have to wait until your green card is processed before you can use it to legally work in the U.S. This can take up to a year, so consider applying at least 12 months before graduation or before your OPT expires.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To qualify, you must either have an advanced degree or exceptional ability. As a startup founder, you must prove that your company has strong potential to be successful and make a positive impact in the U.S. in the future. This could be an economic impact such as creating more jobs or a social impact such as providing a public service.</p>\r\n<p>International students from China and India may want to pursue the EB-1A visa over the EB-2 NIW visa. This is because the EB-2 NIW processing time for individuals from these countries is much longer than the processing time for the EB-1A visa.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>EB-1A&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The EB-1A visa is another permanent immigration option for individuals with extraordinary abilities. The criteria are almost identical to those for the O-1 visa, but the standard for acceptance is higher with the EB-1A. This is the most difficult immigrant visa to acquire because you must prove that you are in the top 1% of your field. However, the EB-1A visa is ideal for qualifying international students from China and India. The EB-1A offers shorter wait times for individuals from these countries than the more popular EB-2 NIW visa.</p>\r\n<p>Like the EB-2 NIW, the EB-1A does not immediately grant applicants work authorization once the petition is approved. EB-1A approval starts the green card process, and startup founders will need alternative work authorization until their green card is fully processed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Tips For Success As An International Student Founder</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t wait until graduation to begin preparing your work visa application, as it may take time to meet the requirements for certain visas. Even if you are not ready to launch your startup, begin researching entrepreneur visa options while you are still in school. During college and OPT, you can <a href=\"https://legalpad.io/blog/what-you-can-do-now-if-you-arent-qualified-for-the-o-1-visa-yet/\">strengthen your portfolio to increase your chances of being accepted</a> for an O-1, E-1A, or EB-2 NIW visa. There are many actions you can take to meet the extraordinary ability requirements for these visas, some of which include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Published Material</strong>: Try to get featured in the press during school by networking with journalists on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/\">LinkedIn</a> and pitching your story to news outlets like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/\">TechCrunch</a> and <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/\">Forbes</a>.</li>\r\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Awards:</strong> Join industry-relevant competitions that are nationally or internationally recognized.

Understanding the different types of colleges is key to knowing which schools you should apply to.</p>\r\n<p>Application processes can be long and often come with a fee, so you will want to be strategic about which schools to apply to. Begin the process of researching colleges and universities before it&rsquo;s time to start applying to give yourself enough time to make an informed decision. Whether you are a domestic or international student, think about your academic and career goals and what type of college experience you want to have. This can guide you in researching and choosing the right U.S. college for you.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Top Factors In Choosing A College In The U.S.</strong></h2>\r\n<p>An important part of how to apply for college in the U.S. for international students is choosing the right colleges to apply to. The top factors to consider when choosing a college in the U.S. are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Programs offered</li>\r\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Cost</li>\r\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Employability&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Ranking &amp; Prestige</li>\r\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Selectivity</li>\r\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Size</li>\r\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Location</li>\r\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Athletics</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If your long-term goal is to live and work in the U.S., it&rsquo;s important to consider these factors. The decision of which school to attend can impact your job search process and access to career opportunities in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Programs Offered</h3>\r\n<p>When researching schools to apply to, you should look at the quantity and quality of the degree programs they offer. If you want the flexibility to explore different fields of study, you may want to attend a large university with multiple different colleges and specializations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For quality, look at how involved professors are in supporting students. For example, some colleges assign academic advisors to each undergraduate student. Many colleges have niche specializations that they are known for. This can help if you will be looking for a job in the U.S. related to that niche. For any programs you are interested in, look at the core requirements and think about how much flexibility you want to take elective classes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Cost</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The cost of college in the U.S. depends largely on whether the school is public or private. Public schools receive funding from the government and are cheaper for students. Private schools are more expensive but often offer more merit and need-based financial aid to students who are accepted. Don&rsquo;t be discouraged by the price of private universities in the U.S. There are many <a href=\"https://www.interstride.com/scholarships-for-international-students/\">scholarship opportunities for international students</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Employability&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Higher education in the U.S. is more expensive than it is in many other countries. Before choosing a U.S. college or university, students should think about the return on investment (ROI) of their education. This means looking at the career assistance that the school provides during students&rsquo; studies and especially post-graduation.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand that <a href=\"https://www.interstride.com/blog/creating-opportunities-through-professional-networking/\">the majority of people in the U.S. get their jobs through connections</a>. Some colleges and universities have partnerships with employers in the area and may even have programs set up to assist international students in finding jobs after graduation. Look at any networking events, job fairs, and other employment support offered by the school and by the specific degree program you are looking at.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Ranking and Prestige</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The ranking and prestige of a university are big factors for international students seeking the best that U.S. higher education has to offer. The prestige of your college also influences your employability after graduation. Generally, the higher a college or university is on the list of <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges\">U.S. News Best Colleges Rankings</a>, the more prestige the school has in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Going to a prestigious college increases your academic credibility and professional capabilities. This can boost your resume and help you when applying for jobs. Additionally, many of these colleges and universities have strong alumni associations to facilitate networking and community after graduation.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Selectivity</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Selectivity, or acceptance rate, refers to how many students are admitted to a college or university in relation to the total number of applicants. Selectivity is one of the factors that influence ranking, and the more selective a school is, the more prestigious it is usually considered to be. For example, the acceptance rate for many top-tier universities like <a href=\"https://www.harvard.edu/\">Harvard</a> and <a href=\"https://www.stanford.edu/\">Stanford</a> is 4%. The higher a school&rsquo;s acceptance rate is, the higher the probability that you will be admitted.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Size</strong></h3>\r\n<p>There are two elements of size to consider &ndash; the size of the college and the size of the specific degree program. A large college or university may have a larger campus with more on-campus housing and work opportunities. This can be especially beneficial for students coming from another state or country. A downside to large colleges is that class sizes are often larger which may mean fewer opportunities to get one-on-one support from professors. On the other hand, small colleges may have smaller class sizes that offer a more personalized learning experience.</p>\r\n<p>However, because degree programs at many U.S. colleges have a lot of freedom over how they operate, there can even be large differences between programs and departments at the same college. Some programs are small and competitive, requiring an additional application process after admittance to the university. Other programs are large with mainly lecture-style classes. Do research online and talk to current students if possible to get a feel for the size of the school, the program, and the classes.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Location</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Each state and region in the U.S. is unique, and therefore, the location of the college will have a large effect on your experience there. There are pros and cons to studying in a city versus a rural area.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Many colleges and universities in rural areas in the U.S., like <a href=\"https://new.sewanee.edu/\">Sewanee University</a> in Tennessee, focus on building a close-knit, on-campus community. If you want to really get to know your classmates, professors, and other university staff, a small, rural university may be a good option for you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Urban areas tend to be more politically and socially liberal than rural areas. This may affect the local community&rsquo;s openness to outsiders. Areas that are large professional hubs such as New York City, Los Angeles, and Silicon Valley tend to have larger percentages of international students and may have more career opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Urban Colleges Pros:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li aria-level=\"1\">More likely to have access to public transportation</li>\r\n<li aria-level=\"1\">More cultural and ethnic diversity</li>\r\n<li aria-level=\"1\">More job opportunities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Rural Colleges Pros:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li aria-level=\"1\">More on-campus housing&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Lower cost of living</li>\r\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Get to know a different side of the U.S.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A major downside to going to a rural college is that you will most likely need a car to leave campus as most rural areas do not have public transportation. International students may also find it surprising that some urban areas, especially in the southern and mid-western regions of the U.S., also do not have comprehensive public transportation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Athletics</h3>\r\n<p>Sports are a major part of college culture at many, but not all, U.S. colleges and universities. If you are an athlete, check to see if athletic recruiting is an option and if the school provides financial aid for athletes. Large universities usually have more robust athletics departments than liberal arts colleges and other specialized schools. For high school students interested in athletic recruitment, do research on what sports recruit students the most and which ones are the least competitive for recruitment such as tennis, lacrosse, and ice hockey.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While college coaches do recruit international students, if you are outside of the U.S., we recommend reaching out to coaches yourself with a recruiting profile and/or video highlighting your athletic skills. International students are often eligible for financial aid through athletic recruiting as well as other benefits like more academic support and networking opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Tips On Selecting The Right Institution</strong></h2>\r\n<p>No two colleges in the U.S. are the same. They vary greatly from the programs offered to the amount of cultural diversity among the student body. Starting your research early will ensure that you apply to the schools that best fit your goals and expectations for college. While factors like ranking and prestige are influential to many students and families, it&rsquo;s also important to research the quality of the programs and the employability of the degrees they offer. Whether you want to stay in the U.S or return home after graduation, choose programs where you get the most return on investment from your education while also enjoying the experience.</p>', 1, 'approved', 0, NULL, '2023-03-22 16:12:12', '2023-03-22 16:12:12'),

From academic and professional errors to social life blunders, here are seven mistakes to avoid as an international student in the U.S.</p>\r\n<p><strong>First mistake: missing course registration</strong></p>\r\n<p>Course registration is particularly important, as it largely determines what classes each student will take for the semester. Since many classes have only limited slots, missing course registration can cause students to not be able to take the classes they need, which can affect their schedule in future semesters and may even limit a student&rsquo;s ability to graduate on time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The add/drop period, a time where students can add new classes, drop existing classes, or switch class sections, usually lasts for one to three weeks and typically occurs at the beginning of each semester. Students can connect with their career center for help as they explore their academic and career options, along with their school&rsquo;s specific dates for course registration and the add/drop period.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Second mistake: making friends with only students from one&rsquo;s own country</strong></p>\r\n<p>One of the most common mistakes an international student can make is only socializing with students from their native country. Although this may be the most comfortable social move, and it is definitely alright to have some of those friends, it prevents international students from learning more about America&rsquo;s culture and removes the cultural immersion aspect from the study abroad experience.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Third mistake: taking advice from other students&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>Other students can be extremely helpful when learning about a university, its requirements, and the recommended classes and activities one should take for their degree program. However, it is also important to consult academic advisors, professors, and other non-students. They almost always have information and resources that other students do not know about, and can be great sources of advice. Furthermore, international students should not rely on friends for immigration advice, but instead consult their international student office or an immigration attorney.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Fourth mistake: Being under- or over-involved</strong></p>\r\n<p>Being involved is important, yet international students can often do too much or too little. Participating in too many activities and clubs outside of class can leave one without enough time to sleep, relax, or have an active social life. On the other hand, being under-involved can leave a student missing out on important activities outside of class that can have an impact on their job prospects and social life. It is important to be balanced, as being involved can help build one&rsquo;s resume, skills, and experiences for future job searches.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Fifth mistake: Not completing any projects or paid/unpaid internships</strong></p>\r\n<p>Projects and internships are essential for obtaining future employment or research opportunities in the U.S., as international students have limited options. In addition to succeeding academically, international students should strive to participate in unpaid or paid projects or internships, as lacking those experiences can severely hurt one&rsquo;s ability to obtain a competitive job after school.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Sixth mistake: Not having a clear understanding of the U.S. work authorization</strong></p>\r\n<p>When one is applying to jobs and internships alongside their American peers, it can be easy to forget about the different work and internship regulations and deadlines that apply to international students in the U.S. International students should carefully explore the <a href=\"https://www.interstride.com/blog/how-to-legally-work-in-the-u-s-as-an-international-student/\">different options to legally work within the U.S</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Seventh mistake: Not using the career center and campus resources effectively</strong></p>\r\n<p>Many students, both international and domestic, often overlook their university&rsquo;s career center. The career center can provide great advice on preparing a resume, practicing interviews, finding companies that recruit on-campus, employer connections, and more. Utilizing it effectively can lead to greater success in finding an internship or job.</p>', 1, 'approved', 0, NULL, '2023-03-22 16:14:27', '2023-03-22 16:14:27'),

The shortage of workers has affected every industry and almost every business, resulting in delays for everything from hamburgers to high-end automobiles.</p>\r\n<p>Yet, still, many American companies remain reluctant to hire international students and recent international graduates of American universities and colleges. The decision to overlook this sizable and talented pool of prospective employees is often based on bad information.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, many hiring managers misunderstand the American immigration system, resulting in lost opportunities for both the companies and foreign nationals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at seven of the most pervasive myths and why they are wrong.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Myth 1: I Need To Sponsor Their Visa</strong></h2>\r\n<p>For international students and recent international graduates, this simply isn&rsquo;t true. That&rsquo;s because these two groups are eligible to work in the U.S. after graduation for up to three years on their F-1 student visas through a program called Optional Practical Training (OPT).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The standard <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/optional-practical-training-opt-for-f-1-students\">OPT</a> is a 12-month work authorization program that permits international students in all career fields to gain professional experience without having to apply for an H-1B visa. In general, you must work in a job that is directly related to your area of study.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A two-year extension of standard OPT is available to those who have earned science, technology, engineering or manufacturing (STEM) degrees. This includes a wide range of degrees, in psychology, economics, business, and <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/stemList2022.pdf\">more</a>, and are not colloquially considered STEM but are nevertheless STEM-designated by the Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Each year, about 200,000 workers who came to the U.S. as international students gain valuable experience through the OPT program, with about a quarter of those working under the STEM extension program.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In 2022, President Biden expanded the STEM extension program to include 22 new degree programs. So there is a good chance that your company may be eligible to hire under the STEM extension.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Myth 2: It&rsquo;s Expensive</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Myth 2 is an extension of the sponsorship myth. Many employers think they must sponsor young international workers, which does require an investment on the part of the employer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>But, again, sponsorship is not required for international students who are still in school or who have recently graduated. For those who are eligible to work through the OPT program, there is no additional cost to the employer when compared to hiring domestic employees.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Myth 3: It&rsquo;s Time-Consuming</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Again, the reason this myth is wrong is because of the invaluable OPT program. Because the program allows people to work under their student visa for a period of time, no additional work is required.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All you must do is provide an offer letter, just as you would for a domestic job applicant. By educating yourself on the process of hiring international students, you can actually save yourself and international candidates time. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Myth 4: I Have To Prove They Are Not Taking Jobs From Americans</strong></h2>\r\n<p>No. First of all, with the job market the way it is right now, nobody is &ldquo;taking&rdquo; jobs from anybody. After all, there are about two jobs out there for every one person looking for a job.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Nonetheless, even in a more normal job market, this is not true. Again, this myth is a misunderstanding of the OPT program, which has no such requirement. Employers must provide such documentation only when hiring and sponsoring foreign citizens for permanent resident status.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Myth 5: I Need A Lawyer</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Again, OPT is easy to navigate and does not require any additional work compared to hiring domestic workers. Therefore, you do not need a lawyer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Myth 6: They Will Leave</strong></h2>\r\n<p>This myth poses a legitimate question: What happens after a student&rsquo;s OPT work authorization runs out. Unfortunately, the myth comes up with the wrong answer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Most employees who came to the U.S. as international students will not leave. Instead, they&rsquo;ll apply for a new visa status through the H-1B program, which authorizes work for another 6 years. Admittedly, H-1B is a bit trickier for the company. This is when the employer must apply on behalf of the employee, with related costs ranging from $5,000 to $7,000, primarily in legal fees.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Still, that&rsquo;s a small price to pay to keep an employee that is already trained and now has experience under his or her belt, especially when a labor market is as tight as it is. According to recent research, the average cost to onboard a new employee is about $4,000.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Even if H-1B doesn&rsquo;t successfully go through or you choose a pathway other than H-1B, there are many other alternatives for you to retain your international talent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Myth 7: They Won&rsquo;t Fit In</strong></h2>\r\n<p>International graduates bring the best of both worlds. They had robust experience in the U.S. academically through their degrees, socially through their lived experience, and professionally through various on-campus and off-campus internships. They also bring diverse perspectives from different cultural backgrounds &ndash; and for graduate students, often international work experience &ndash; that will add to your team. If anything, international graduates have tremendous adaptability. They understand how to adapt to new countries, cultures, and work environments.&nbsp;Recent research has discovered that 45 percent of Fortune 500 companies in the U.S. were founded by immigrants or by their children.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Whether they fit in is up to you more than it is up to them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It is also up to you to take advantage of international graduates as a valuable and diverse pool of skilled talent.&nbsp;</p>', 1, 'approved', 0, NULL, '2023-03-22 16:16:13', '2023-03-22 16:16:13'),

It can be a little tricky at first to find a health insurance policy that checks all of the necessary boxes. However, it is not as complicated as it seems at first. By taking some key elements into consideration while searching, it is possible to narrow the choices down considerably.</p>\r\n<h3>Visa</h3>\r\n<p>The type of visa that an international student has is a key factor. Some U.S. visas have a health insurance requirement and others do not. F-1 visa holders, for example, are not required by the U.S. government to maintain health insurance. In contrast, J-1 holders must have an active healthcare plan while living in the United States.</p>\r\n<p>H-1B visa holders also have to get a health insurance plan. Health insurance may come from an employer or be supplied by the visa holder, but it is important to note the length of time that it takes to be considered a long-term visitor. H-1B holders are considered short-term visitors until they reach the 6-month mark, at which point they become eligible for health care plans under the Affordable Care Act. During the preliminary phase of the H-1B, a private health insurance plan is needed.</p>\r\n<h3>Transitions</h3>\r\n<p>Another common consideration is how health insurance requirements change when making transitions in life.</p>\r\n<p>If you are a current student looking to apply for an H-1B visa or Green Card, you may need to change your policy from the one provided by your school.</p>\r\n<p>It is also possible that&nbsp;F-1 visa holders who wish to stay and work in the US after graduation will apply for Optional Practical Training, also known as OPT. If granted permission to stay in the US and work, obtaining health insurance will be a necessary step in that process.</p>\r\n<p>There are many types of transitions that international student may go through. Making sure that health insurance issues don&rsquo;t crop up can be helpful.</p>\r\n<h3>School</h3>\r\n<p>Many schools will require international students to have health insurance regardless of visa type. In fact, most universities expect their international student body to have some form of health insurance. Some schools are very specific in what they require, as well as deciding on which insurance companies and policies their students must adhere to. Others allow their foreign students to</p>\r\n<p>Checking with student advisors before looking for health insurance independently is crucial.&nbsp;All international students should be aware of the rules that affect their health insurance situation. If maintaining insurance means keeping a scholarship, a student visa, or a place in an educational institution, then understanding how it works is an essential part of life as a student.</p>\r\n<h3>Cost and Coverage</h3>\r\n<p>Not all health insurance policies are the same. So, figuring out the cost and coverage is the next step. Health insurance companies usually offer several tiers of coverage to international students. Each tier provides additional features and coverage. With greater coverage comes an additional cost, however. So, it is always wise to carefully consider what the insurance policy can offer and what your needs are.</p>\r\n<p>Examples of additional features to expect include travel insurance, passport insurance, lower copays, greater options for doctors and medical centers, eye checkups and glasses, dentistry, and more.</p>\r\n<h3>Limitations</h3>\r\n<p>While comparing plans, checking for service limitations should also be on the to-do list. Health insurance plans in the U.S. always have a few limitations so making sure that an insurance plan that you are interested in isn&rsquo;t lacking in a specific area of need is a good idea.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Some questions to ask include:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Can I use my international student health insurance in my home country when I visit home?</li>\r\n<li>Is maternity covered?</li>\r\n<li>How much will I pay when I go to the doctor or hospital (deductible)?</li>\r\n<li>What happens if I get into a car accident?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-7016 lazyloaded\" src=\"https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Health-Insurance-2-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Health-Insurance-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Health-Insurance-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Health-Insurance-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Health-Insurance-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Health-Insurance-2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-src=\"https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Health-Insurance-2-1024x683.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Health-Insurance-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Health-Insurance-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Health-Insurance-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Health-Insurance-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Health-Insurance-2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></p>\r\n<h2>Health Insurance For International Students</h2>\r\n<p>Below are some of the best health insurance plans for international students.

If you have all of the requested documents, it is a good time to schedule your driver&rsquo;s license tests.</p>\n<p>Unless the DMV in your state recognizes foreign driver&rsquo;s licenses and offers to transfer your current foreign license to a state document, it will be necessary to schedule a driving and written test.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6978 lazyloaded\" src=\"https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_4-scaled-e1623401318286-1024x740.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_4-scaled-e1623401318286-1024x740.jpg 1024w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_4-scaled-e1623401318286-300x217.jpg 300w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_4-scaled-e1623401318286-768x555.jpg 768w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_4-scaled-e1623401318286-1536x1110.jpg 1536w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_4-scaled-e1623401318286.jpg 1920w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"740\" data-src=\"https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_4-scaled-e1623401318286-1024x740.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_4-scaled-e1623401318286-1024x740.jpg 1024w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_4-scaled-e1623401318286-300x217.jpg 300w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_4-scaled-e1623401318286-768x555.jpg 768w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_4-scaled-e1623401318286-1536x1110.jpg 1536w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_4-scaled-e1623401318286.jpg 1920w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></p>\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n<h2>Paperwork</h2>\n<p>There are several pieces of documentation that need to be submitted, including ID documentation, immigration forms, and sometimes proof of address. These requirements vary from state to state but most will require the following.</p>\n<h3>Form I-94</h3>\n<p>Form I-94 is a form that comes from the U.S. Customs office and shows a record of your travel history, including arrival and departure dates. The DMV will need to see this information because driver&rsquo;s license approvals often depend on how long a foreign applicant will remain in the United States.</p>\n<p>Form I-94 is available <a href=\"https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Form I-20</h3>\n<p>Another important document that you will need to show is Form I-20. Form I-20 shows your eligibility for a driver&rsquo;s license based on your status as a &lsquo;nonimmigrant student&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>More information about Form I-20 and what you can use it for can be found <a href=\"https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/prepare/students-and-the-form-i-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Social Security Number (SSN)</h3>\n<p>Another document that you will need to bring in most cases is your Social Security Number (SSN). Your social security number is not needed by DMVs in every state, however.</p>\n<p>For more information, the Social Security Administration website can be found <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Proof of Residence</h3>\n<p>As part of the driver&rsquo;s license process, DMV offices also need to see that you are a resident of the state in which you are applying for the driver&rsquo;s license. It is not allowed to carry driver&rsquo;s licenses from multiple states and this is a requirement for all driver&rsquo;s license applicants.</p>\n<p>Accepted documents to show for proof of residence may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>bank records and statement</li>\n<li>official mail addressed to you at local address</li>\n<li>rental/lease agreements</li>\n<li>mortgage bill</li>\n<li>school documentation</li>\n<li>insurance documentation</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Passport and Visa Information</h3>\n<p>Finally, you will need to provide your passport and copies of your current student visa as proof of ID. Simply providing your passport is usually sufficient to fulfill this requirement as the DMV officer will make any necessary photocopies at the DMV office.</p>\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n<h2>Driving And Written Test Requirements</h2>\n<p>If the DMV determines that it will not accept the foreign driver&rsquo;s license as an equivalent, a driving and written test will be required. These tests can usually be scheduled on the same day, but not always.</p>\n<p>The written portion of the evaluation will test your working knowledge of the local driving laws, signs, and procedures relating to accidents and other emergency situations.</p>\n<p>The driving test will help the DMV determine your readiness for driving on US roads and usually involves taking a short drive with an instructor, following directions as you drive.</p>\n<p>Once complete, the driver&rsquo;s license process has come to an end and the DMV will provide an answer quite quickly in most cases.</p>\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n<h2>Regional Differences</h2>\n<p>Before applying for a driver&rsquo;s license in any state, it is important to contact the local <a href=\"https://dmv.nv.gov/50_state_dmv_list.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DMV office nearest you</a> to learn what requirements exist for international students.</p>\n<p>While most states follow similar rules and regulations regarding international driving licenses, there can be significant differences as well.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6981 size-large lazyloaded\" src=\"https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_3-scaled-e1623405229991-1024x499.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_3-scaled-e1623405229991-1024x499.jpg 1024w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_3-scaled-e1623405229991-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_3-scaled-e1623405229991-768x374.jpg 768w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_3-scaled-e1623405229991-1536x749.jpg 1536w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_3-scaled-e1623405229991-2048x998.jpg 2048w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"499\" data-src=\"https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_3-scaled-e1623405229991-1024x499.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_3-scaled-e1623405229991-1024x499.jpg 1024w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_3-scaled-e1623405229991-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_3-scaled-e1623405229991-768x374.jpg 768w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_3-scaled-e1623405229991-1536x749.jpg 1536w, https://www.interstride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drivers-license-process_3-scaled-e1623405229991-2048x998.jpg 2048w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></p>\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Driving in the U.S. can certainly bring a lot of positive elements into your life as an international student.

It follows the state mechanism that differentiates its legislature, executive and judiciary from one another, although not as clearly demarcated as in many western countries. The highest legislative body in China known as the National People&rsquo;s Congress (NPC), functions as the power centre that keeps the state system intact and supervises both the legislature and the judiciary.

Composed of newly elected delegates to both bodies- the NPC and the CPPCC function as deliberation organs and lay down the vision for progress for the upcoming year as part of China&rsquo;s state structure. <br><br>Notably, this year&rsquo;s session of the NPC also confirmed the reappointment of Xi Jinping as the President of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China (PRC) for a third consecutive term- a provision that was amended in the State&rsquo;s Constitution by the NPC in 2018. Popularly considered a &lsquo;rubber stamp&rsquo; in the country\'s party-driven approach to governance, the NPC and CPPCC play an important role in facilitating the deliberation process for law-making as well as providing an adequate representative mechanism for those in the minority.
